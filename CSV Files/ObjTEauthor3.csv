"34","108","634490","2052","2","In 1817, in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, Turner visited the Netherlands for the first time. He spent just a day and a half in Dordrecht (known locally as Dort), making numerous pencil sketches, and exhibited this luminous view of the city from the north at the Royal Academy in 1818. Turner, who often indulged in playful rivalry with his fellow artists, may have been stimulated by Augustus Wall Callcott’s homage to the Dutch Old Masters, “The Pool of London” (Bowood Settlement, Wiltshire), exhibited to acclaim at the Royal Academy in 1816. Described by the “Morning Chronicle” in May 1818 as “one of the most magnificent pictures ever exhibited,” Dort was immediately acquired by Turner's patron Walter Fawkes. The price was five hundred guineas, a huge sum, though as James Hamilton has recently noted, it is likely that Turner was never paid, since Fawkes was in chronic debt, and Turner had himself lent him three thousand pounds (Hamilton, 2001). The painting hung in the Drawing Room at Farnley Hall until 1966, when it was purchased by Paul Mellon.Although Turner did not visit the Netherlands until he was over forty, he was familiar with important Dutch Old Master paintings in British collections from early in his career, and his first Royal Academy submission, Fishermen at Sea (Tate, London), testifies to his admiration for Rembrandt. Dort pays tribute to one of Turner’s most formative Dutch influences, Aelbert Cuyp; the motif of the packet boat is directly borrowed from Cuyp’s Maas at Dordrecht (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.), which was exhibited at the British Institution in 1815. Dort is as much a personal artistic statement as an homage to an Old Master, however; its contrast of cool and warm colors and bright chromatic scale (a contemporary viewer told the diarist Joseph Farington that “it almost puts your eyes out” [Farington, “Diary”, vol. 15, p. 5191]) mark the emergence of Turner the colorist and anticipate the brilliance of his work of the 1820s.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Gillian Forrester","2007-01"

"68","108","634547","6799","2","“Eagle, A Celebrated Stallion” is one of the finest of Ward’s portraits of thoroughbred racehorses and exhibits his remarkable ability to create an accurate physical portrait of a particular animal. At the same time, he evokes a transcendent Romantic type—suggesting the latent power of a barely tamed creature, full of drive, dash, and tension, whose swollen veins and flaring nostrils to some extent conjure up the elemental forces of nature itself.Having dwelled for years in the shadow cast by the great equine painters, George Stubbs and his contemporary, the slightly younger Sawrey Gilpin, Ward was obviously aware that his portraits of horses would inevitably be compared with theirs. It was not until 1809, shortly after Stubbs and Gilpin had died, that Ward felt comfortable venturing into the subgenre, his mastery of which is demonstrated in “Eagle”.Eagle and Ward’s other great racehorse paintings differ from Stubbs's in that the essential ingredient of human control—jockeys, grooms, attendants, owners, which to some extent defined the very purpose of the thoroughbred—is conspicuously absent. Neither is there much evidence of the mounting yard, finishing post, or rubbing-down house. Instead, the noble creature exists on its own, standing in a landscape that is laden with potential drama.Eagle, celebrated for his strength and speed, was a prize-winning bay colt by Volunteer out of a mare by High Flyer and a descendant of Old Partner. He was eventually exported to Virginia, where he influenced the development of American bloodstock. Eagle’s owner, Thomas Hornby Morland, used an engraving after Ward’s portrait as the frontispiece for his influential treatise “The Genealogy of the English Race Horse” (1810).","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Angus Trumble","2007-01"
"101","108","634527","6799","2","Arthur Devis was the most prolific painter of conversation pieces, having produced more than three hundred in various standard sizes, such as this, mostly for members of the largely Tory landed gentry and professional classes. The genre did not appeal so much to Whig grandees. Although he studied and perfected many of the techniques of the Dutch Old Masters, Devis was uneasy drawing from the live model, possibly because of his training as a miniature painter. He relied on a small wooden lay figure or mannequin that he kept in the studio and, when necessary, dressed it in miniature costumes.In this two-figure conversation piece, Mr. and Mrs. Hill pose in the corner of a room which, though sparsely decorated, contains a large oval Italianate landscape painting mounted as an overmantel and a Chinese vase in the fireplace—it must be summer. Seven exquisitely painted cups and saucers on the tea table indicate that five guests are expected, while Mr. Hill has placed his book (octavo) on the mantelpiece. His pose reflects nearly contemporaneous rules for gentlemen as set out in etiquette manuals. This does not necessarily suggest that Mr. Hill was trying especially hard, nor that Devis felt it necessary to underline the point. Nevertheless, Mr. Hill’s right-angled feet, and the position of his hand in his waistcoat, are what François Nivelon’s “Rudiments of Genteel Behavior” (1737) recommended.It is tempting to identify the sitters as the Tory lawyer and eccentric George Hill (ca. 1716–1808) and his wife, Anna Barbara, daughter and heir of Thomas Medlycote of Cottingham, Northamptonshire.

"414","108","634284","1252","2","Alfred Herbert Palmer, the artist’s son and biographer, who owned “The Harvest Moon”, described it as a typical example “full of Shoreham sentiment” and “not without some of the accompanying peculiarities.” He went on to comment, “There is nothing out of place in the laden wagon with its team of oxen, or in the harvest labourers, for their dress proclaims them labourers of long ago” (Palmer, 1892, pp. 46–47). Christiana Payne has countered the suggestion that the subject may be anachronistic or may be intended to evoke an earlier time, by noting that oxen continued to be used in parts of Britain throughout the nineteenth century and that the smocks worn by the harvesters were standard dress in the period.Although the depiction of harvesting by moonlight seems characteristic of Palmer in the Shoreham period and undoubtedly contributes to the visionary intensity of the scene, Payne also indicates that workers continuing into the night to bring in the harvest had a basis in actual agricultural practice. What does seem fanciful is the crowding of the workers, men and women together, with no open space to set the sheaves—artistic license to emphasize the bounty of the harvest (Payne, 1993, p. 102).","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Scott Wilcox","2007-01"
"428","108","634493","6799","2","This ambitious group portrait shows three generations of the family of the Scottish goldsmith and banker Andrew Drummond (1688–1769), a widower. The date of Mr. Drummond’s death, in 1769, has generally been taken to indicate a “terminus ante quem” for the painting, but it is not entirely certain that his inclusion in the family group, sitting with his dog and somewhat isolated in the middle, was not a commemorative gesture of reverent piety postmortem. In 1766 Zoffany had painted an oval single-figure portrait of Andrew Drummond that obviously provided him with the model for this part of the composition. In both, he took care to include Dr. Drummond’s expensive snuffbox, his splendid malacca cane with a gold crutch handle, and, most important, the dog (seated this time on the garden seat). The cane and snuffbox are still owned by Drummonds Bank.Mr. Drummond’s son, one of the members of Parliament for Thetford, John Drummond (1723–74), stands to the left with his son and daughter, their ponies, and a groom. John Drummond’s aristocratic wife, Lady Charlotte (née Beauclerk, the family of the dukes of St. Albans), and their two other children complete the right-hand side of the composition. Andrew Drummond’s bank was particularly well patronized by artists, including Thomas Gainsborough, the sculptor Henry Cheere, the plasterer Joseph Rose, the architects Sir William Chambers and Henry Holland, and the landscape gardener Lancelot “Capability” Brown. Zoffany himself opened an account at the bank in 1765. Later, members of the Drummond family were crown contractors for the payment of British troops during the American War of Independence.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Angus Trumble","2007-01"
"568","108","634525","1252","2","Bonington left Paris for Italy with his friend and pupil Charles Rivet, later Baron Rivet, on 4 April 1826. They traveled quickly through France and Switzerland, arriving in Milan on 11 April. Bonington was eager to press on, for, as Rivet noted, he “thinks only of Venice” (Noon, 1991, p. 56). Reaching Verona on 18 April, they arrived in Venice a few days later and stayed there until the end of May. Bonington sketched incessantly in graphite, watercolor, and oils. These sketches provided subject matter for much of his finished art in the remaining months of his life. From Venice the two friends went on to Padua, Florence, Pisa, Lerici, Genoa, and Turin, never lingering in any one place. Rivet was back in Paris by 20 June, though Bonington may have done some further traveling on his own in Switzerland.In 1825 Bonington had begun sketching en plein air in oils on small millboards, which he discovered during his trip to London. He seems to have brought back about two dozen such sketches on millboard from Italy (Noon, 1991, pp. 59–60). This oil sketch shows the north side of the Grand Canal near its entrance, looking towards the Bacino di San Marco. While Bonington has deftly captured the brilliant shimmering light on the water and the facades of the palazzi, topographical accuracy was clearly not a priority. He has elided the famous Palazzo Gritti-Pisani from the succession of buildings lining the canal.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Scott Wilcox","2007-01"
"666","108","634526","6799","2","Constable’s cloud studies represent perhaps one of the most original and surprising aspects of his evolving approach to the art of landscape painting. This exquisite example is in several respects unusual. Unlike numbers of other bona fide cloud studies—the product of hours of plein-air work on Hampstead Heath in 1821 and 1822, together with gradually lengthening sets of notes in which Constable recorded on each the weather conditions, topographical orientation, and the time of day—a narrow strip of “landscape” is clearly indicated along the bottom margin of the panel, and birds wheel and swoop in what is in effect a foreground that elsewhere consists entirely of void and energy, the intangible space held in by clouds scudding far overhead.Michael Rosenthal has noted the congruence of the larger Romanticism of Constable’s strong feeling for skies and also the regulation of light in the landscape by the predictable behavior and motion of specific kinds of cloud, with lines from “Prelude VI,” by Wordsworth, that appear to reflect a comparable and quintessentially Romantic outlook:“The unfettered clouds and regions of the Heavens,Tumult and peace, the darkness and the light—Were all like workings of one mind, the featuresOf the same face, blossoms upon one tree:Characters of the great Apocalypse,The types and symbols of Eternity""(cited in Rosenthal, 1983, p. 167).","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Angus Trumble","2007-01"
"896","108","634530","7020","2","This elegant portrait is a testament to the relationship of mutual respect and friendship between the artist and his subject, George James Welbore Agar-Ellis (1797–1833). Agar-Ellis, a politician and art lover, had persuaded the British government to purchase the Angerstein collection of paintings (which Lawrence had effectively curated) as the nucleus for the National Gallery. Lawrence and Agar-Ellis established a firm friendship based on mutual regard, and the artist was later commissioned to paint Agar-Ellis’s wife and young son in a charming double portrait (1827–28; private collection). Agar-Ellis served as one of Lawrence’s pallbearers.The virtuosity of this portrait can in part be explained by the extraordinary amount of time and labor that Lawrence invested in it. Twelve sittings are recorded in Agar-Ellis’s diary between October 1823 and May 1824, several lasting for three or more hours (Northamptonshire Records Office, Annaly of Holdenby Collection, ref. X1384). The sitter’s handsome features are complimented by a masterfully painted costume of velvet and fur, referred to in Agar-Ellis’s diary as a “crimson =Titian-like pelisse,” which Lawrence had personally selected for the portrait. The face is painted smoothly in comparison with the slash of blue ribbon and the bristling fur. A second white highlight glimmers in Agar-Ellis’s right pupil, a trick that Lawrence used to suggest the glassy moisture of the human eye with remarkable fidelity. Considered the consummate portrayer of female beauty, Lawrence here delineates an equally compelling vision of masculinity. The portrait—a study in soft curves, beginning with the sitter’s mop of brown curls and his delicately crimped pinky finger and extending through his relaxed posture—proves that Lawrence’s penchant for sinuous torsos and sloping shoulders was not reserved for his female sitters.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Cassandra Albinson","2007-01"
"904","108","634531","9449","2","John Linnell purchased a copy of Robert Bloomfield’s “The Farmer's Boy: A Rural Poem” (1800) around 1815 (Story, 1982, p. 79). A self-taught “Peasant Poet,” Bloomfield was also known as “The Suffolk Poet” for his commemoration of agricultural life in that area. He acknowledged the tedium and anxiety of living off the land in the story of Giles, the farmer’s boy, and his various labors throughout the seasons. In summer, for example,“The Farmer’s life displays in every partA moral lesson to the sensual heartThough in the lap of Plenty, thoughtful still,He looks beyond the present good or ill”.(Wickett and Duval, 1971, p. 80)The poem cycle celebrates a rural community and the sense of the divine spirit that pervaded its pursuits. As Linnell turned away from organized religion and toward a sacred conception of landscape, he would have appreciated this sentiment. His 1830 painting “The Farmer Boy”, exhibited at the Royal Academy, commemorates this connection to Bloomfield. “The Shepherd Boy” is thought to be a smaller replica of this earlier work, likewise inspired by Bloomfield and the motto of “The Farmer's Boy”, taken from Alexander Pope’s poem “Summer—The Second Pastoral; or Alexis” (1709): “a Shepherd's boy, he seeks no better name.” The child gently engages the viewer, looking up as he plays the fipple flute, an instrument similar to a recorder.The humble origins of the shepherd boy and his humility parallel the pastoral identity of Christ as a “shepherd of men.” Linnell’s close relationship with Samuel Palmer in this period motivated this exploration. In 1828 and 1829, Linnell and George Richmond visited Palmer at Shoreham in Kent, where the younger artist was engaged in his own visionary experiments with landscape painting. Linnell maintained this symbiotic relationship among landscape study, artistic practice, and religious belief throughout his career.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Morna O'Neill","2007-01"
"1113","108","634534","7836","2","Although this painting is more commonly known as “The Silver Age”, it was first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1777 as “The Market Girl”. It has been suggested that in his travels to Paris Walton may have become acquainted with Chardin, whose influence can be perceived in the scale, composition, and tranquil mood of the scene. The genre paintings that Walton exhibited in the mid-1770s certainly constituted a shift away from his early portraits in style and subject matter. The model may be one of Walton’s nieces, who posed for several of his genre scenes.The publisher Valentine Green assigned the alternate title when he published an engraving after this work paired with another, after a painting by Benjamin West (probably “A Domestic Scene”, RA 1776, no. 321), as “The Silver Age” and “The Golden Age”, respectively. In Ovid’s “Metamorphoses”, the Golden Age was one of “immortal spring” during which the earth“. . . yet guiltless of the plough, And unprovok’d, did fruitful stores allow.During the Silver Age, spring “was but a season of the year”:Then ploughs, for seed, the fruitful furrows broke,And oxen labour'd first beneath the yoke.”(Ovid, “Metamorphoses”, p. 5)The classical metaphor is not entirely apt, not least because “The Golden Age” depicts a view, through a doorway, of a man plowing a field. Green, however, may have intended a more general association concerning the passage of time and innocence. The sleeping baby in the foreground of West’s composition, blissfully unaware of the world’s travails, could be taken as a younger incarnation of the market girl, bundled against the cold, whose basket of chickens signals her participation in an agricultural economy.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Eleanor Hughes","2007-01"
"1264","108","627047","7112","2","In the late 1920s Paul Nash produced a series of paintings where a single, often mysterious object dominates the composition. In Souvenir of Florence, Nash represents a vast amphora which he had seen in Florence’s railway station in 1925 and was sufficiently impressed with to sketch for future reference. Four years later he used it in a surrealist setting, apparently floating above the river Arno with the Ponte Vecchio glimpsed in the background. The reflection of a faceless man and woman eating in a restaurant is caught in the amphora’s polished surface. As a container for wine, the amphora and its restaurant setting hint at the sensory pleasures of the body. Yet, the apparent distance between the couple and the urn-like quality of the amphora also evoke a melancholy quality, suggestive of isolation and even death.

"1301","108","627051","7112","2","This view from a window represents the walled garden at Pigott's near High Wycombe, the farm where the artist and typographer Eric Gill had moved his household in 1928. David Jones was a regular visitor to Pigott's in the 1930s and became part of Gill's inner circle. At this time Jones wrote: ‘I always work from the window of a house if at all possible. I like looking out on the world from a reasonably sheltered position. I can’t paint in the wind and I like the indoors-outdoors, contained yet limitless feeling of windows and doors…The rambling, familiar, south, walled, small, flower-beddedness of Pigotts…did something.’ A deeply Catholic artist, Jones inflected his representations of the natural world with strong theological significance. In Walled Garden he evokes the idea of the Virgin Mary as a hortus conclusus, an enclosed garden in which the Eternal Word was nurtured and given flesh. Here the exuberance of the garden at Pigott's echoes the opening words of Mary's great Magnificat spoken to her cousin Elizabeth at the Visitation: ‘My soul doth magnify the Lord, And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.’ (Luke 1: 46-47).","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Matthew Hargraves","2011-03"

Sir Gareth leaps from the bed, sword in hand, but is wounded in the struggle with his assailants. Jones thought this subject from Mallory about sexual continence and punishment was ‘of great psychological interest’ and the composition introduces elements that repeatedly contrast pain and pleasure: naked flesh with naked steel, soft fabrics and hard armor, flaming brands and roaring fires.

"2137","108","634706","7836","2","The coronation of James II took place on 23 April 1685. Owing to “the wearisomeness that the Fatigue of those Glorious Processions and stately Ceremonies of the Coronations had bred in their Majesties,” the fireworks display planned for that evening had to be postponed until the next day, when “between five and six [o'clock] London seem’d to have disembogued and emptied its Inhabitants into the Boats and on the Shoars of the Thames” (Lowman, 1685, p. 1).This drawing is part of a series of four views showing the crowds of spectators gathering on the river and the decorated pontoon stationed opposite Whitehall Palace from which the fireworks were launched. The first view (now in the collection of the Boymans-van Beuningen Museum in Rotterdam) is inscribed “No. 1” and looks upstream; the third and fourth views (both numbered, in the Boymans-van Beuningen and National Maritime Museum, respectively) look downstream from a position farther upriver. In this drawing the dimensions, the cropping of the vessels on the far right, and the direction in which the oarsmen are rowing suggest that it was originally the left-hand panel of the second view (now in the collection of the National Maritime Museum), which is taken from directly opposite the pontoon, perhaps from Whitehall itself.“Celebration on the Thames” demonstrates not only van de Velde’s expertise in drawing various types of vessels, including ceremonial barges, wherries, and East India Company vessels (identifiable by their striped flags), but also his persuasiveness in depicting the human figure in miniature.

"3727","108","634711","1252","2","Blake claimed that his method of relief etching, which allowed him to create text and image together in the same process on the same copper plate, had come to him in a vision of his dead brother, Robert. Using an acid-resistant varnish, Blake could draw and write on the plate. When etched in an acid bath, image and text, protected by the varnish, would be left standing in relief. The areas in relief would then be inked and printed. Assisted by his wife, Catherine, Blake would then strengthen the printed lines with pen and ink and color the images with watercolor. Although labor-intensive, the entire process of production was controlled by Blake without the compromises of working with a commercial publisher.In 1788 Blake made his first experiments with relief etching to produce illustrated texts, “All Religions Are One” and “There Is No Natural Religion”. A year later he used the process to create “Songs of Innocence”, his first illuminated book of poetry. Couched in the form of a book for children, the simplicity of Blake’s lyrics and of the charming designs in which they are embedded are deceptive. The “Songs” are profound meditations on the human condition, and the richness and complexity of Blake’s vision became more fully apparent with his production of a companion volume, “Songs of Experience”, in 1794. The following year he combined the two books under the title “Songs of Innocence and of Experience”.Blake produced none of his illuminated books in large editions; indeed, each copy was unique, with variations in coloring and even in the order of plates. The twenty-six known copies of “Songs of Innocence”, four “Songs of Experience”, and twenty-four “Songs of Innocence and of Experience” (a figure that also includes separately issued copies of “Innocence” and “Experience” that were later combined by collectors or dealers) were among Blake’s best sellers.

"1517","108","634716","6799","2","The English poet, man of letters, satirist, wit, translator of Homer, and editor of Shakespeare, Alexander Pope (1688–1744) was one of the greatest figures of the Enlightenment. Largely self-educated, Pope was also one of the first English poets to generate a comfortable income from nondramatic writing. His brilliance was such that he came to dominate the world of English poetry and letters in the first half of the eighteenth century in a manner to which no subsequent poet could reasonably aspire or possibly emulate. The fluency and elegance of his poetic writing were matched by the originality and sharpness of his intellect. Pope was a Catholic, a friend of Jonathan Swift, a keen gardener, and a neighbor, at Twickenham, of the traveler and diarist Lady Mary Wortley Montagu.Pope’s fame was such that he was also one of the most frequently portrayed men of the age. Wimsatt catalogued more than sixty portraits, many of which exist in multiple versions, and still others reappear from time to time. There are portraits of Pope by Godfrey Kneller, Jonathan Richardson the elder, Jervas, Hoare of Bath, and Van Loo. And there are busts by Michael Rysbrack and four marble versions of the present work, which in due course spawned sets of four successfully marketed library busts of Shakespeare, Milton, Dryden, and Pope, based on the original terracotta modello (1738, Barber Institute of Arts at the University of Birmingham) by Louis-François Roubiliac.This fine version, which was given to the Center by Paul Mellon, was possibly commissioned by the author, Tory politician, and diplomat Viscount Bolingbroke (1678–1751) and was subsequently owned by two prime ministers. It is not clear whether it was one of the two marble busts of Pope that were listed as “marble head” and “marble bust” in the sculptor’s studio sale of 1762. The socle is modern. The other three versions are at Temple Newsam House, Leeds; the Fitzwilliam collection at Minton, Peterborough; and the Shipley Art Gallery, Gateshead. George Vertue thought Roubiliac’s busts of “Mr. Pope more like than any other sculptor has done I think” (Vertue, “Note Books”), and Reynolds told Malone that the sculptor had described Pope’s appearance during the sittings “as that of a person who had been much afflicted with the headache, and that he should have known the fact from the contracted appearance of the skin above the eyebrows, though he had not otherwise been apprized of it” (Wimsatt, 1965, p. 229).

"4168","108","634717","2052","2","In 1771 Hearne began working for Sir Ralph Payne, the recently appointed Governor-General of the Leeward Islands, a group of sugar colonies consisting of Antigua, Nevis, St. Christopher’s (now St. Kitts), and Montserrat. Hearne spent three and a half years making working drawings and, after his return to England in 1775, produced twenty large and highly finished watercolors for Payne, of which only eight are now known. This watercolor depicts St. John’s at Antigua, the traditional center of government for the Leewards, where Payne had taken up residence, despite owning a large sugar estate on St. Christopher’s. After a major slave insurrection in Antigua in 1736, the colonial government had petitioned successfully to have a regiment stationed there, but the white West Indians living on the island remained in constant fear both of another slave revolt and of a French attack from nearby Guadeloupe and Martinique.One of Hearne’s watercolors is a vivid depiction of a hurricane that devastated Antigua on the night of 30 August 1772. The Center’s watercolor shows the newly rebuilt barracks and hospital and the renovated courthouse, as well as members of the 60th Royal American Regiment at exercise. The drawing functions as a pendant to Hearne’s image of the hurricane; if the violence of the storm is read as metaphor for insurrection and political instability, then Hearne’s panoptic view reinforces the message that Antigua was a well-governed and orderly colonial possession. Eliding the conventions of the military survey and the picturesque landscape, Hearne meticulously delineates the pristine and substantial government buildings, placing the spire of St. John’s church strategically at the center of the composition. He also includes discreet allusions to the sugar industry, showing, on the right, cane fields devoid of laborers, and behind, a sugar factory with a smoking chimney. Completing Hearne’s account of the social hierarchy, and drawing on the stereotype of the indolent slave, is the group in the foreground, consisting of a free soldier probably of mixed race, two slave children playing in a barrel, two men playing a game of chance, who appear from their dress to be domestic slaves, and a field slave, flanked by a cornucopia of fruit.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Gillian Forrester","2007-01"
"4110","108","634718","2052","2","A compulsive draftsman, Turner invariably traveled with a sketchbook. On his death, he left in his studio 290 sketchbooks, which formed a significant part of his bequest to the British nation (now housed at Tate, London). Just five sketchbooks outside of the Turner Bequest are recorded, including this one, which Turner seems to have used in the mid-1840s, when he was living mostly in Chelsea with a widow named Sophia Booth; it apparently remained with Mrs. Booth after his death in 1851. Bound in red leather, and in immaculate condition, the pocket-sized sketchbook, which still bears the label of the London stationer Pillsworth, contains vivid drawings in watercolor and graphite of the sea, shore, and sky, some obviously recording observations made on the spot and others more likely drawn from Turner’s imagination, such as his sketches of whale hunts.The date and location of the views depicted remain uncertain, but the dates of June 9 and July 24 are inscribed on two of the sketches, and Andrew Wilton (1986, p. 9) has suggested convincingly that Turner may have used the sketchbook along the British coast near Folkestone and possibly at Boulogne in the summer of 1845. Turner, who typically drew with great speed and economy, seems to have worked through the sketchbook in one direction, making watercolor drawings on the right-hand leaves, and then to have turned it upside down, working from back to front. The sketchbook contains a sequence of thirteen graphite drawings, annotated with color notes, which apparently record the progress of a single sunset over the sea. According to John Ruskin, who inventoried the Turner Bequest, this was Turner's “last sketchbook”; it seems unlikely that Turner would have abandoned a lifetime’s habit of drawing out of doors during the last five years of his life, despite his failing health, but if this is indeed the last, it is a compelling testament to the artist’s insatiable curiosity about the world and his penetrating powers of observation (Wilton, 1986, p. 9).","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Gillian Forrester","2007-01"

A standard edition of the poem was taken apart and the pages mounted on large sheets of paper on which Blake drew and colored his designs. Blake created 537 illustrations on 269 sheets (now in the British Museum, London), only a fraction of which were actually published. With the model of Blake’s watercolors for “Night Thoughts” in mind, Blake’s friend John Flaxman commissioned a set of watercolor illustrations of the poems of Thomas Gray as a birthday gift for his wife, Ann, known as Nancy. Again the pages of a standard edition of the poems were mounted on large sheets, perhaps left over from the earlier project, on which Blake created his watercolor illustrations. Unlike his illustrations to “Night Thoughts”, these 116 watercolors on fifty-eight sheets (all now in the Paul Mellon Collection, YCBA) were never intended for publication.On each of the pages of text Blake marked with a graphite “X” the lines that he intended to illustrate. The three pages displayed in the 2007 YCBA “Legacy Exhibition” convey something of the range and variety of Blake’s responses to Gray’s poetry.

Blake himself identified with the bard, writing in the Introduction to the Songs of Experience: “Hear the voice of the Bard!” For the opening of Gray’s poem, Blake produced one of the most powerful designs in the set. Departing from his standard practice, he chose to illustrate a line later in the poem. He marked a double “X” in the upper left of the letterpress page, which corresponds to the similarly marked line, “And weave with bloody hands the tissue of thy line,” several pages further on.

Dance regarded this activity as ""a great relaxation from the severed studies and more laborious employment of my professional life,"" but these distinctive drawings nonetheless betray the author's occupational concerns. His chosen formula of a pencil or chalk outline, occasionally tinted with watercolor, is close to the technique used for architectural drawings of the period, and the profile view he adopted habitually for the portraits suggests analogies with an orthographic elevation. Dance may also have been influenced by the contemporary taste for silhouettes, which were often referred to as ""profiles.'Dance's portraits were admired by his contemporaries, and in 1793 he embarked on a project to draw likenesses of his fellow Royal Academicians, with a view to having them engraved and published. Seventy-two of Dance's portraits, including his ""Academical Heads,"" were etched in soft-ground by William Daniell and eventually published in two volumes (1808-14), with a dedication to the connoisseur and amateur artist Sir George Beaumont.

He toured prisons throughout the Continent, finally dying in Russia in 1790 from a fever contracted during one of his prison visits. Howard had declined to be painted by Romney in 1785; but after Howard's death, Romney set to work on what he hoped would be a series of paintings celebrating Howard's heroic efforts in alleviating human misery. In the early 1790s Romney produced a series of powerful drawings of nightmarish prison scenes in which Howard's experiences are transmuted into universal images of anguish and despair. Although Romney was one of the most fashionable society portrait painters of eighteenth-century England, success in the area of art he most valued - history painting - eluded him. As with so many of his other ambitious plans for history paintings, his projected paintings of Howard visiting prisons never progressed beyond these drawings.On August 2, 1786, a mentally disturbed woman named Margaret Nicholson tried to stab George III; the monarch, escaping unharmed, pardoned his assailant, who was confined to Bethlehem Hospital. Dighton's drawing is a piece of visual reportage, attempting to convey the actual appearance of the attempted assassination. For Dighton, the son of a printseller and himself a caricaturist and printseller, topicality and timeliness were of the essence.

It depicts British troops disembarking in North Holland in the late summer at the start of a short, unsuccessful campaign to instigate a counter-revolution against the French-supported Batavian Republic and secure the restoration of the House of Orange.

After Studying at the newlyt-established Royal Academy Schools, the versatile artist quickly consolidated his reputation in London as a painter and draftsman. Although his portraits, landscapes, and history and genre subjects were favorably received, Wheatley was constantly in debt, and in 1779 he fled to Ireland to escape his creditors. Wheatley established a thriving portrait practice in Dublin, and he also produced landscapes and genre subjects, including a large group of watercolors depicting two traditional peasant fairs, Donnybrook and Palmerston. These attractive drawings were extremely popular with his fashionable Irish clientele, but neither Wheatley's choice of subject matter nor his mode of representation are as straightforward as they may seem at first sight. Founded in 1204, and held on the periphery of Dublin, Donnybrook Fair was notorious drunkenness, licentiousness, and violence (indeed, the term ""donnybrook"" is still used today as a synonym for a disorderly brawl), and in the later eighteenth century it provided the Irish ruling class with a potent reminder of the ever-present possibility of social unrest. In 1778 a writer in the Freeman's Journal noted ""how irksome it was to friends of the industry and well being of the Society to hear that upwards of 50,000 persons visited the fair on the previous Sunday, and returned to the city like intoxicated savages."" Such complaints were commonplace, and Donnybrook Fair was eventually abolished in 1867. This refined neutrally colored watercolor, with its subdued and cheerless groups of peasants, betray no hint of the Saturnalian character of the fair the Whatley's contemporaries found so disturbing, and, like may other examples of Picturesque genre art of the period, seems to have been produced with the intention of reassuring his respectable clientele.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Gillian Forrester","2001-05"

The graphite drawing on vellum, or plumbago, as it became known, was developed as a cheaper alternative to the miniature and could also be used readily as a model for engraving. The plumbago was popular throughout the first half of the eighteenth century, and as Donaldson's miniature shows, this rather austere form of drawing was capable of considerable refinement and tonal subtlety in the hands of a skilled practitioner. Jonathan Richardson's portrait of Sir Hans Sloane (cat. 1) is another example of this genre, though the drawing is less highly finished than Donaldson's.The little-known miniaturist John Donaldson was born in Edinburgh; he showed early promise and, after being awarded premiums by the Edinburgh Society of Arts in 1757 and 1758, moved to London to develop his career. Donaldson exhibited portrait miniatures of Richard Cooper in London at the Free Society and the Society of Artists in 1762 and 1764, and cat. 5 may have been exhibited on one or both occasions.

These engagements led to his massive project, undertaken with his brother Nathaniel, to record sites of antiquarian interest throughout England and Wales - by far the most extensive of a number of such efforts by topographical artists in the century. Between 1721 and 1745 the Bucks produced over 423 engravings of castles, monasteries, and other ruins and an additional eighty-seven prospects of English and Welsh cities and towns.

One of those ""Horrible Imaginings"" is the elaborate drawing of Death on a Pale Horse, which Mortimer exhibited at the Society of Arts in 1775 together with a companion drawing illustrating the line from I Corinthians, 15:55 ""O Death! Where is thy sting? O Grave! Where is thy victory?"" After Mortimer's death, both drawings were etched by Joseph Haynes and published by Mortimer's widow Jane on January I, 1784. Mortimer's Subject is the Fourth Horseman of the Apocalypse from the Book of Revelations, his imagery drawn from the famous Dürer print of the four horsemen and seventeenth-century by Stefano della Bella. A related working drawing owned by the connoisseur and critic Richard Payne Knight is in the British Museum. If Mortimer's predilection for ""Horrible Imaginings"" suggests an excessive and morbid temperament, Edward's confirms that the artist was ""imprudent in his conduct, and intemperate in his pleasures, by which he injured his health."" Yet his taste in subject matter went beyond such personal quirkiness or pathology. His macabre and sensationalistic imagery was shared by Henry Fuseli, and Mortimer's Death on a Pale Horse is but an early instance of an apocalyptic strain in later eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century art.

The traditional emblematic associations (comets were believe to portend the death of rulers or dramatic changes in the status quo) retained their currency in the popular imagination but were underpinned by greater knowledge of celestial phenomena, which was facilitated by increasingly sophisticated instruments, such as the telescope.This watercolor is related to the extensive series of views of Windsor Castle and Great Park produced by Paul and Thomas Sandby (see cats. 134-5), and the circumstances of its production and circulation provide an illuminating example of how artists recorded and disseminated scientific knowledge in the period. The drawing commemorates one of the most celebrated astronomical events of the century, the transit of a meteor on the evening of August 18, 1783.

It has been suggested that Lwrence's sensitive portrait of the younger William Lock may be a study for an untraced portrait of the sitter exhibited as the royal Academy in 1791. Lock's attire and hairstyle indicate a later dating however, and Lawrence did not usually make preliminary drawings for his paintings, preferring to prepare them by drawing directly on the canvas with chalk.This technique clearly fascinated his sitters. Joseph Farington recorded in his diary for 7 May 1794: ""This morning I sat to Lawrence when He drew in my portrait with black chalk on the Canvass, which employed him near 2 hours. He did not use colour today. - This is his mode of beginning,"" and Lady Elizabeth Leveson-Gower recalled: ""what struck me most…was the perfection of the drawing of his portraits before any colour was put on."" Lawrence also made a number of chalk portraits on canvas which he seems to have regarded as drawings in their own right, and no. 13 almost certainly falls into this category. Moreover, the portrait was owned by Lock, which implies that Lawrence would have considered it a finished work.The sitter was the son of the connoisseur William Lock (1732-1810), was one of Lawrence's first sitter and a close friend of the artist. The younger Lock (1767-1847) was a keen patron of the arts and an aspiring artist, but after viewing Rome he lost faith in his talent and gave up painting, though he continued to draw.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Gillian Forrester","2001-05"

Butterfly pupae were attached to the canvases and hatched during the course of the exhibition, leaving butterflies to fly freely around the room. Bowls of fruit and sugar water on the central table allowed the butterflies to subsist until they died.

Eight monochrome paintings, with dead butterflies embedded in their surfaces, were presented alongside a series of cubes, and a table with overflowing ashtrays.

Sir Francis commissioned Robert Smythson to create this showpiece as a crown upon the very lands—rich in coal—-that comprised the foundation of his family's fortune. One of his contemporaries remarked that Sir Francis had “out of ostentation to show his riches, built at vast charges a very stately house, both for the splendid appearance and curious workmanship of it” (Camden, 1695, p. 482). The most notable feature of Sir Francis's house was the “Prospect Room,” located in the double-tiered central roof tower. Accessible only via dark narrow staircases in its corner walls, this capacious, light-filled room—with no designated function other than enjoyment—floated above the house and landscape and provided those inside with an unimpeded view of every aspect of the font and fruits of the Willoughby wealth (Friedman, 1989, pp. 149-51).From his characteristic bird's-eye view, the painter surveys the magnificent house and extensive property and carefully depicts not only the glories of the Hall's unusual architecture—with its four-corner tower design, extensive tracery glazing, and raised Prospect Room—but also the daily workings and pleasures of life at Wollaton. Siberechts's patron, Sir Francis’s great-great-grandson Sir Thomas Willoughby, 1st Baron Middleton, and his elder sister Cassandra, mistress of the house, made significant interior improvements to the Elizabethan structure, and Sir Thomas commissioned a number of views of the house and estate from the painter in the 1690s. Siberechts’s portrait not surprisingly emphasizes these recent changes, including: the newly laid-out, fashionable formal gardens; the bleaching field; the garden of specimens planned and gathered together by Sir Thomas; the newly planted “wilderness”; and a neatly tended bowling green. A sumptuous record of place, this prospect is, most of all, a visual hymn to the harmonious accord of God, Nature, and Man found at Wollaton.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Julia Marciari-Alexander","2007-01"
"4986","108","634257","6799","2","The academy students, each suggesting a different stage in the awakening of artistic genius, are gathered around a copy of the famous Hellenistic sculpture “Nymph with a Shell” (Louvre), which was widely known through casts and reproductions. But while Wright alludes to an artistic exemplum, he has also grounded his subject in fact. Art students were regularly given the exercise of drawing sculpture in lamplight and candlelight. Showing the sculpture as though warmed into life by the glow of the candles, Wright pays homage to the transformative, enlivening, even magical powers of light. He may also be gently alluding to the famous classical legend of Pygmalion, King of Cyprus, who carved a statue of Venus, the goddess of love, and in so doing fell in love with it. In answer to his prayers, the goddess herself inhabited the statue and made it come alive.Somewhat more prosaically, it has recently been shown that this painting and its companion, Philosopher by Lamplight (Derby Museum and Art Gallery), which Wright exhibited with the Society of Artists at Spring Gardens in May and early June 1769, offered a terse commentary upon the recent establishment of the Royal Academy under the presidency of Sir Joshua Reynolds. In the context of contemporaneous art-world politics, the Philosopher by Lamplight was “at once both a learned reworking of Salvator Rosa for the connoisseurs, and perhaps also a fitting warning to the new RAs about the transience of earthly glory,” while the Academy formed a kind of “critique of the hierarachical structure of the new RA by contrasting it with an ideal democratic school with clear allusions to the now defunct St. Martin's Lane Academy” (Hargraves, 2005, p. 97).","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Angus Trumble","2007-01"
"6514","108","634264","7112","2","By tradition Rowlandson's sprightly drawing of a decrepit bon vivant is a caricature of William Douglas, 4th Duke of Queensbury (1725–1810), or “Old Q,” as he was popularly known. As the most famous rake of the later eighteenth century, his amorous exploits were the stuff of legend. The sexual appetites of this lifelong bachelor were prodigious and, according to one who knew him in his final years, “he pursued pleasure under every shape; with as much ardour at fourscore as he had done at twenty” (Wraxall, 1836, vol. 2, p. 160). Rumor had it he was even drawing up plans to build a seraglio onto his house at Richmond (Robinson, 1895, p. 203). Rowlandson exploits Queensbury's voraciousness to the full, allowing him to revel in the incongruous union of the eager young mistress and her geriatric lover. He is shown, as one wag described him in 1794, “insatiate yet with Jolly's sport . . . ogling and hobbling down St James's Street” (Thomas Mathias as cited in Godfrey, 2001, p. 222). Sadly for Queensbury, Rowlandson's caricature was right on the mark, for by this time “his person had then become a ruin” (Wraxall, 1836, vol. 2, p. 160). One eye had failed, his hearing was going, and he had lost nearly all his teeth. But despite his physical frailty he still cut a dashing figure. In this drawing Rowlandson portrays the old duke as an irrepressible dandy, his Star of the Thistle prominently displayed on his fashionably tight-fitting clothes (Ribeiro, 1989, p. 132). As one friend noted, in later life “even his figure, though emaciated, still remained elegant” (Wraxall, 1836, vol. 2, p. 160). Rowlandson inscribed the drawing in his own hand, describing Queensbury as a “Debauchee.” In eighteenth-century parlance the “debauchee” was wholly abandoned to the pursuit of sensual pleasure, inhabiting a totally different league of immorality from the merely occasional, or accidental, debaucher.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Matthew Hargraves","2007-01"
"6510","108","634266","7112","2","Like many of his fellow artists, Rowlandson continually mocked the foibles of connoisseurs in a variety of ways over the course of his career. Around the time he made this drawing, the eighteenth-century culture of connoisseurship had received a major boost, as art flowed more freely than ever in the wake of the French Revolution (Bermingham, 1995, p. 503). As Archibald Alison put it, echoing earlier authors, the “fine arts are . . . addressed to the imagination, and the pleasures they afford, are described . . . as the Pleasures of the Imagination” (Alison, 1790, p. 1). In this instance three connoisseurs pay a visit to an artist's studio to judge his latest offering: a historical painting of Susanna and the Elders. While the artist gazes at the ceiling in a pose of studied nonchalance, they study his unfinished canvas. But rather than enjoy the pleasures of the imagination, these connoisseurs are content to stop at the pleasures of the flesh. Like latter-day Elders, they lust over the nude Susanna, just as their forebears had in the apocryphal addition to the Book of Daniel. One viewer seats himself within a few inches of the easel to gawk at her body, his desiccated companion peers through an eyeglass and licks his lips, and a third smirks gleefully from a greater distance. Typically for Rowlandson the humor lies in the incongruous juxtaposition of contrasts: the beauty of Susanna and the ugliness of the connoisseurs; Susann’'s innocence and the connoisseurs’ lust; her youth and their age. The heart of the satire, however, is found in the men's hands, which grasp their walking sticks and eyeglasses with desperate tension. Ironically when it comes to enjoying real women, Rowlandson suggests these impotent old lechers will be forced to confine themselves to the pleasures of the imagination.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Matthew Hargraves","2007-01"
"7671","108","634271","1252","2","Boys’s work in watercolor was closely modeled on that of his friend and mentor Richard Parkes Bonington; indeed, many of Boys’s early watercolors either copy works by Bonington or adopt the same subjects. Such is the case with this watercolor, which presents the Institut de France from almost the same vantage point as a watercolor by Bonington now in the British Museum. Bonington’s watercolor probably dates from the last year of his life, a time when he and Boys were frequently working together. Boys's watercolor is not, however, a simple copy. The angle at which Boys presents the famous building by Le Vau has shifted slightly, the foreground incident on the Quai Conti is different, and most significantly Boys includes the Pont Royal, which Bonington had inexplicably omitted. Although Boys took over many elements of Bonington’s virtuosic watercolor style, there is in Boys’s handling a crispness and precision, if also a hardness, not evident in Bonington’s more sensitively atmospheric use of the medium.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Scott Wilcox","2007-01"
"5466","108","634275","2052","2","Turner first visited Yorkshire in 1797. The initial impetus for the trip seems to have been the commission by his patron Edward Lascelles for a series of views of Harewood, the estate situated between Leeds and Harrogate; Turner also made an extensive and meticulously planned sketching tour of the north of England and Scottish borders, filling his sketchbooks with drawings to which he was to refer throughout his career. Around this time Turner met the Yorkshire landowner, politician, and collector Walter Ramsden Fawkes, and the two men became close friends. Turner first visited Fawkes’s estate, Farnley Hall, in 1808; a popular houseguest, he returned almost every year until Fawkes’s death in 1825, and both the estate and the family came to have a deep personal significance for him. Fawkes was one of Turner’s most active patrons, acquiring seven oils and more than two hundred watercolors, many of them commissions; this outstanding collection is now mostly dispersed, and several of Fawkes's Turners are now owned by the Center.A keen natural historian, Fawkes commissioned Turner to contribute watercolors to his “Ornithological Collection”, which consisted of five volumes of drawings of birds and their eggs. Turner also made a group of watercolors recording the interiors and exteriors of Farnley Hall and chronicling everyday activities on the estate. These delightful drawings provide a vivid and intimate portrait of Farnley’s domestic life, as well as a valuable record of Fawkes’s installation of his collection. An inveterate angler, Turner spent many pleasurable hours while at Farnley on the Washburn river, waiting for a catch and meditating on the landscape. This vivid drawing is a study for a finished watercolor, which is also in the Center's collection (Wilton, “Turner”, 1979, no. 540). The present sheet originally belonged to the “Large Farnley Sketchbook” (Tate, London) and was acquired by John Edward Taylor, who began to collect Turner's watercolors in the 1860s and who had a taste, radical at that time, for the artist's sketches.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Gillian Forrester","2007-01"
"5472","108","634277","2052","2","The eighteenth-century fascination with volcanoes, and Vesuvius in particular, deepened in the nineteenth century, fuelled by the eruptions of Vesuvius in 1794, 1807, 1819, and 1822. Turner was alert to both the intellectual and aesthetic possibilities that the evolving discipline of geology offered; he cultivated friendships with pioneering geologists, including John MacCulloch and Charles Stokes, and his sketchbooks contain detailed records of geological phenomena.During the second decade of the nineteenth century Turner, a keen proponent of the Sublime, had his own burst of volcanic activity. In 1815 he exhibited his canvas “The Eruption of the Souffrier Mountains, in the Island of St Vincent” (Butlin and Joll, 1984, no. 132); two years later the print publisher W. B. Cooke commissioned Turner to make companion watercolors of Vesuvius, showing the volcano in eruption and repose (Wilton, “Turner”, 1979, nos. 698–99). This watercolor, the third of the group and the most spectacular, would also have been made around the same time as Cooke's drawings, if the inscription on the back, which is not in Turner's hand, is correct.Turner did not visit Italy until 1819, and he may have based the Vesuvius drawings on the work of another draftsman, most likely James Hakewill, whose sketches Turner used for a group of watercolors commissioned as designs for Hakewill’s publication “Picturesque Tour of Italy”. Although the Center’s Vesuvius drawing was neither exhibited nor engraved, its extremely high degree of finish suggests that Turner had made it for a specific purpose, perhaps as a commission. Although Turner's patron Walter Fawkes owned the watercolor, it was not included in Fawkes’s exhibition of his collection at his London house in 1819, which featured his outstanding holdings of Turner’s work. The work was probably acquired by Fawkes (and possibly even made) sometime later.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Gillian Forrester","2007-01"
"5967","108","634280","2052","2","In the fall of 1796 Girtin made his first independent sketching tour, visiting York, Ripon, and Durham and traveling up the Northumbrian coast via Lindisfarne to Jedburgh, on the Scottish borders. The sketching tour was a key element of his artistic practice, as it was for Turner, who traced a similar itinerary with Girtin's advice the following year. Girtin seems to have developed a deep affinity for the north of England. The panoramic views he produced after his first tour mark a decisive break with his early practice, derived from his master, Edward Dayes, of depicting close-up views of ruins; they also signal a radical shift in his palette to stronger colors. Girtin revisited Yorkshire on a number of occasions, having acquired several important patrons there, notably Edward Lascelles, who owned the Harewood estate and who acquired eighteen works by the artist. Lascelles was also one of Turner’s early patrons, but in 1799, the art-world insider Joseph Farington recorded in his diary that “Mr. Lascelles as well as Lady Sutherland are disposed to set up Girtin against Turner, who they say effects his purpose by industry—the former more genius—Turner finishes too much” (Farington, Diary, vol. 4, p. 1154). While one might take issue with Lascelles’s judgment in relation to Turner, Girtin's Yorkshire watercolors are indisputably virtuoso masterpieces of atmosphere and poetry, though his lack of finish also provoked charges of slovenliness from less enthusiastic viewers. Lascelles hired Girtin as a drawing master and reportedly set aside a room at Harewood permanently for the artist’s visits. This watercolor is one of a number of views of the Priory Mill, which stands on the left bank of the river Nidd, a mile downstream from Knaresbrough Castle and some ten miles from Harewood. Girtin, notoriously, relied on fugitive pigments, in particular indigo, for his spectacular effects, and many of his watercolors have faded appallingly; this vivid watercolor, however, is remarkably fresh and suggests why Girtin's patrons found his work so compelling.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Gillian Forrester","2007-01"
"5001","108","634282","6799","2","In the famous letter of 23 October 1821 to his friend Archdeacon Fisher, John Constable reported: “I have not been Idle and have made more particular and general study than I have ever done in one summer, but I am most anxious to get into my London painting room, for I do not consider myself at work without I am before a six foot canvas” (Constable, “Correspondence”, p. 76). To some extent, the scale of Constable's great “six-footer” landscape paintings reflected both his high aspirations for landscape in general, and his desire for professional recognition and financial security. Yet Hadleigh Castle, which comes relatively late in the sequence of six-footers, in 1829, is among his least characteristic landscape views on a grand scale. Compared with “The White Horse” (1819; Frick Collection, New York), “Stratford Mill”, “The Hay Wain” (1820 and 1821; both National Gallery, London), and other paintings, each with its determined avoidance of heroic elements of the picturesque, each with its affectionate embrace of the seemingly commonplace features of rural life, “Hadleigh Castle” stands apart. The foreground vantage point is elevated and offers no convenient path into the difficult topography that descends toward the river flats to the right. The ruined castle clings to a rocky escarpment that winds into the distance and separates shepherd and cowherd and, presumably, their flock and herd. On the right, the Thames estuary opens out to the east, creating an immense, flat, gleaming distance beneath lowering clouds and theatrical slanting rays of morning sunlight. It is a landscape of revelation, not of domesticity.Constable had visited Hadleigh in the summer of 1814 and in a letter to his wife, Maria, described the place as “a ruin of a castle which from its situation is really a fine place—it commands a view of the Kent hills, the Nore [the stretch of water beyond the mouth of the Thames] and the North Foreland &amp; looking many miles to sea” (Constable, “Correspondence”, vol. 2, p. 127). He drew the place in his sketchbook (Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London) and appears not to have considered the subject again until fourteen years later, when, in about 1828, he worked up a small oil sketch (Paul Mellon Collection, ycba) and embarked upon the present composition (1829), by way of his accustomed, full-scale six-foot study (ca. 1828–29; Tate, London). He may have been prompted toward the unusually dramatic subject, with its hints at decay and regeneration, by the death from tuberculosis of his beloved wife in November 1828, but it seems that his election, at long last, in February 1829 to full membership of the Royal Academy may also have led Constable to consider the advantages of exhibiting a subject more conventionally picturesque and heroic than might otherwise have attracted him. These two immense changes in his working and personal life obviously went hand in hand. With leaden tact, Sir Thomas Lawrence, the President, had told Constable that he should consider himself lucky to have been elected to the Academy at all, since he had been competing against several talented history painters. Constable's status as an “R.A.” therefore had the effect of raising the stakes, and “Hadleigh Castle” may well reflect his desire to adjust his manner of landscape painting in view of the expectations arising from this new professional challenge, made twice as difficult by the grief he suffered after the death of Maria. To some extent he remained desolate and depressed for the rest of his life—he called himself a ruin of a man. While dwelling on the decay of the medieval building in its pastoral setting and causing the Thames estuary to shine under grand shafts of light, Constable perhaps also alludes to the ancient Christian metaphor of death: all his boats point downstream and, receding, sail out to sea.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Angus Trumble","2007-01"
"5004","108","634283","7020","2","This charming group portrait was painted in the provincial port city of Ipswich, where the young Gainsborough labored in relative obscurity early in his career. John Gravenor, a local apothecary and politician, his wife, Ann, and their two daughters are shown as if resting during a pleasant walk in the country. Gainsborough has chosen a square canvas, an unusual format that indicates that the portrait may have been intended to serve as an overmantel.The square shape of the picture support lends “The Gravenor Family” an insularity and formal harmony. This sense of enclosure within the landscape is accentuated by the wheat and the intertwined trees (symbols of the Gravenors’ matrimonial harmony). The seated younger daughter leans in toward her mother, and Gainsborough’s vivid brushstrokes in the storm clouds on the right further envelop the family in their natural setting. Although the sitters look out toward the viewer, rather than conversing among themselves, they are a remarkably coherent family group.The writer Philip Thicknesse described visiting Gainsborough’s studio in Ipswich around the time the artist was working on the portrait of the Gravenors. According to Thicknesse, there were “several portraits truly drawn, perfectly like, but stiffly painted.” Also on view were landscapes, which gave Gainsborough ""infinite delight"" and which Thicknesse deemed far superior to the artist’s portraits (Thicknesse, 1788, p. 10). In the portrait of John and Ann Gravenor and their daughters the figures are indeed “stiffly painted,” but they charm nonetheless.

"5005","108","634285","6799","2","The actress Frances (Fanny) Barton, better known as Mrs. Abington, was one of the most popular stars of the London stage. She grew up in the slums near Drury Lane; sold flowers in Covent Garden (where she was called “Nosegay Fan”); worked for a French milliner in Cockspur Street; and was employed by the cook and future comedian Robert Baddeley, who gave Fanny her first big break. She married James Abington, one of the king's trumpeters, and became a star in the Drury Lane Company, managed by the actor-manager David Garrick. She created the role of Lady Teazle in Richard Brinsley Sheridan’s “The School for Scandal” (1777). In this portrait, Reynolds (an admirer) portrays Mrs. Abington in one of her most successful roles, that of the young ingénue Miss Prue in William Congreve’s somewhat dated 1694 comedy “Love for Love”. She played that part for the first time in December 1769, and the sittings for this portrait took place either in December or in March and April 1771.Showing her in character (and adopting what was then taken to be a suggestive, or at least unrefined, pose—unthinkable for a lady—and exploiting as a strategically positioned fascinator the Hepplewhite chairback upon which she rests her arms), the work is both a portrait of unusual directness and candor, her thumb coyly hovering on the lower lip, and a “historical” picture, whose associations went beyond the subject's likeness, which Horace Walpole thought “easy and very like” (Mannings and Postle, 2000, p. 56). Reynolds painted at least half a dozen portraits of Mrs. Abington in 1771 and two further paintings that must correspond to surviving notes in Reynolds's appointment books for 1773 and 1780. The latter of these, which is untraced, showed the actress in character once again, this time in the role of Roxalana, the English slave in Isaac Bickerstaff’s play “The Sultan”, which was first performed in 1775 in Drury Lane. In that drama, “the playful, unequal, coquettish Roxalana,” wrote Sir Uvedale Price, “full of sudden turns and caprices, is opposed to the beautiful, tender, and constant Elvira; and the effects of irritation, to those of softness and languor” (Graves and Cronin, 1899–1901, vol. 1, p. 5).","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Angus Trumble","2007-01"

In the Center’s painting, the city is seen from the slopes of Monte Mario, to the northwest of Rome, traditionally the first view of the city seen by pilgrims arriving from the north. To the right, in shadow, is the loggia of the Villa Madama, built by Pope Clement VII from designs by Raphael.Wilson's painting closely echoes a painting of the same view by Jan Frans van Bloemen, known as “l’Orizzonte”, whose importance as a model for Wilson's landscape painting in his early years in Rome has been pointed out by David Solkin (Solkin, 1982, pp. 184–85). Yet the more profound influence of Claude Lorrain is already much in evidence in the eloquent massing of forms and the subtle movement from areas of rich shadow into a luminous distance. While Wilson’s later landscapes would show a more sensitive grasp of naturalistic detail and a more ambitious range of motifs and emotive effects, the Roman views he painted for Dartmouth and others during his stay in the city are unmatched in their coolly glowing light and sense of timeless tranquility.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Scott Wilcox","2007-01"
"6440","108","634495","7112","2","Rowlandson’s portrayal of an audience at the theater captures the culture of display and spectatorship that lay at the heart of eighteenth-century social life (Brewer, 1995, p. 348). Few of these spectators have actually come to watch the play. Instead they are busy studying one another and being scrutinized by figures in the surrounding boxes. Because light levels in auditoriums were not dimmed during performances, London’s crowded theaters provided an ideal venue for this sport of seeing and being seen. Rowlandson was himself a regular habitué of the playhouse; his friend Jack Bannister was a leading comic actor who regularly performed at Drury Lane. Although this scene has been identified as the remodeled Drury Lane that opened in 1775, the architecture does not quite tally, making this a more generic scene of London theater life. These theatergoers occupy the first gallery level of the auditorium, a zone reserved for the polite middling orders of society. Here young gallants try their luck with the seated ladies, a practice described in a contemporary epilogue that was often delivered from the stage to close a night’s entertainment. Thomas King (“Bucks Have at Ye All,” 1768) described the gallery as “The ‘Middle Row’, whose keener Views of Bliss Are chiefly centr’d in a fav’rite Miss; A set of jovial Bucks who there resort, flushed from the Tavern—reeling ripe for Sport—Whisp’ring soft Nonsense in the fair One’s Ear, And wholly ignorant—what passes here” (Pedicord, 1980, p. 247). By dispensing with a clear narrative, Rowlandson allows for an endless range of possible plots for this human drama in the theater, something he may have learned from studying French painting on trips to France. Such open-endedness infuses the scene with an erotic charge and invites the viewer to become a fellow gallery lounger, flirting with the surrounding company in a playful exchange of glances.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Matthew Hargraves","2007-01"
"5084","108","634498","1252","2"," Although the Reverend William Gilpin, the great popularizer of picturesque travel, toured the Lake District in 1772, he did not publish his observations on the tour until 1786. By that date, the Lakes had already attracted a number of writers and artists who found in its scenery native equivalents to the landscapes of Claude Lorrain, Gaspard Dughet, and Salvator Rosa. George Barrett, Philippe Jacques de Loutherbourg, Thomas Hearne, and Thomas Gainsborough had visited the area, and Joseph Farington had actually lived and worked in Keswick from 1775 to 1781. Thomas West’s “Guide to the Lakes”, first published in 1778, had gone through several editions. Thus Gilpin's publication of “Observations, Relative Chiefly to Picturesque Beauty, Made in the Year 1772, on Several Parts of England; Particularly the Mountains, and Lakes of Cumberland and Westmoreland” only confirmed and enhanced an existing appreciation of Lakeland scenery both as a subject for artists and as an object of Picturesque touring.Perhaps spurred by Gilpin’s newly published volume, Towne traveled north in the company of John Merivale and James White, two friends from Exeter, in early August. They reached the village of Ambleside, situated near the head of Lake Windermere, on August 7, the date Towne inscribed on the verso of this watercolor. Using Ambleside as the base for much of their touring, they spent two weeks in Lakes, possibly cutting short their visit because of bad weather (Wilcox, 1997, p. 107).This watercolor, the second in the carefully numbered sequence of drawings Towne produced during the trip, shows the view looking north from Ambleside to Rydal, Grasmere, and Keswick. The artist’s inscription on the drawing’s original mount indicated that the watercolor was “drawn on the spot,” but this would refer only to the underlying pencil outlines. These outlines were later reinforced in pen and ink: a fine line in gray ink in the distant mountains, a heavier line in brown ink in the nearer trees and buildings. Over these outlines Towne has laid flat washes of color. While the effect is formal and decorative, Tim Wilcox has argued that Towne’s method of working up his watercolors was intended to emphasize their origin as sketches (Wilcox, 1997, pp. 13–15), which would seem to be supported by the additional notations on the verso about the time of day and fall of light. Towne exhibited no watercolors from the tour, nor any other Lake District subjects, until his one-man show of 1805. ","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Scott Wilcox","2007-01"
"7681","108","634499","2052","2","The subject of this enigmatic and atmospheric drawing has never been identified; it was untitled by the artist, and “The Geographers” is a later appellation. The composition is indeed dominated by the shadow of the globe looming menacingly over the foreground, but the volume over which the young men pore so intently is depicted as a tabula rasa rather than a map or travel book, and the spaces being charted are more likely those of the dark recesses of the imagination than actual geographical sites. Originally a sheet in one of Brown’s Roman sketchbooks, the drawing suggests something of the intense intellectual climate he experienced there and reflects the preoccupation with supernatural and uncanny themes explored by Henry Fuseli and his circle.The drawing also demonstrates Brown’s fascination with physiognomy, a theoretical system dating back to the Renaissance and based on the premise that facial expressions were an index to human personality. Brown may have become interested in the subject through his association with Fuseli, who made several drawings for Johann Kasper Lavater’s influential treatise “Essays on Physiognomy, Calculated to Extend the Knowledge and the Love of Mankind”. The young man seated nearest the viewer in Brown's drawing has a classical profile—in physiognomonic terms, indicative of nobility of character— whereas the hooked noses and scowling expressions of the standing men hint at their villainous nature. Brown, who made numerous drawings of heads, was described by the amateur artist and connoisseur William Young Ottley as having “a peculiar talent in delineating the human physiognomy which he prosecuted with utmost diligence and perseverance, frequently following a remarkable character day after day until he completely succeeded in obtaining his resemblance and character” (Ottley, 1814, lot 1621). “The Geographers” has a distinguished provenance; it belonged to Ottley, who studied briefly with Brown and purchased the contents of the artist’s studio after his death, and was subsequently owned by Sir Thomas Lawrence.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Gillian Forrester","2007-01"

Several other drawings he made on the same day are known, including a view of the semaphore on Putney Heath (The Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge), a windmill at Barnes (private collection), and a view of Richmond Bridge, farther upstream, that Constable drew the next day (September 9).

"7718","108","634505","7836","2","“Queen Square” is one of a series of four views of London squares that Dayes produced at the outset of his professional career. He exhibited views of Queen Square and Bloomsbury Square at the Royal Academy in 1787; these, along with his views of Hanover and Cavendish Squares, were engraved in 1787 and 1789. Queen Square, first laid out in the early eighteenth century, is located just east of Russell Square and was distinguished for its open prospect of the countryside, looking toward Hampstead and Highgate to the north. The other squares depicted by Dayes also date from an early period of London square building. The variety of the buildings and the established gardens in these older squares may have appealed more strongly to a picturesque sensibility than the architectural uniformity of newer squares such as Bedford Square (begun in 1776).All four of Dayes’s views suggest social tensions underlying the ordered, placid appearance of the squares, which in reality had a reputation for violent crime, particularly robbery, and were seen as potential sites for the gathering of disruptive crowds; as recently as 1780, foot patrols had been stationed in Queen Square during the Gordon Riots (Longstaffe-Gowan, 2001, p. 205). A range of social types populates these images: high and low intermingle in the public spaces while genteel couples stroll within the safety of the fenced-off gardens. A seven-foot lead statue of Queen Charlotte, erected in 1775 by one of the square’s residents, presides over this scene (Blackwood, 1989, p. 44).

"5485","108","634508","2052","2","Between 1799 and 1815, the wars with Napoleon made recreational travel on the Continent more or less impossible, with the exception of a period of less than a year following the 1802 Treaty of Amiens. Turner took advantage of the temporary cessation of hostilities to make his first trip to the Continent, spending three months traveling through France and Switzerland and making more than five hundred sketches. On his return, he dismantled two of his sketchbooks and mounted over a hundred of the most highly finished drawings in an album to show prospective patrons. This proved to be an effective strategy, as Turner received numerous commissions for finished watercolors of Alpine views from collectors, including Walter Fawkes, who was to become one of the artist’s closest friends and most supportive patrons, and who owned this drawing.The watercolor has traditionally been identified with one of Turner’s 1803 Royal Academy submissions, entitled “Glacier and Source of the Arveron, Going Up to the Mer de Glace”, but Eric Shanes has recently suggested that the exhibited work was a watercolor formerly owned by Fawkes and now in the National Gallery of Wales, Cardiff (Wilton, “Turner”, 1979, no. 376) and that Turner made the present drawing for Fawkes around 1814. Both watercolors were included in an exhibition Fawkes held at his London house in 1819. Shanes has painstakingly examined the catalogue and contemporary representations of the installation, noting that the Center’s drawing was exhibited as “Mer de Glace, in the Valley of Chamouni, Switzerland”, whereas the Cardiff drawing bore the title “Source de l’Arveron, Valley of Chamouni”. Neither title corresponds exactly to the Royal Academy submission; moreover, the Cardiff drawing, which is smaller and considerably less ambitious in technical terms, seems a less likely candidate for exhibition at the Academy than the spectacular Yale watercolor.In the absence of conclusive documentary evidence, much of this argument depends on technical and stylistic issues. Although Shanes’s suggestion that an 1803 dating for this highly sophisticated watercolor is too early may be persuasive, it is not inconceivable that Turner could have produced it at that moment in his career, and a dating of 1814 seems somewhat late. Shanes’s thesis is extremely thought provoking, however, and merits more detailed discussion than this entry permits.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Gillian Forrester","2007-01"
"5487","108","634509","2052","2","Turner’s dazzling paintings and watercolors of Venice are among his most celebrated works, and his vision continues to shape our perception of the city today. Turner first visited Venice in 1819, stopping there to draw intensively for a few days en route to Rome. In a state of economic decline in the aftermath of Napoleonic occupation, the former maritime empire was rarely visited by artists at this period, though Lord Byron lived there intermittently between 1817 and 1820, and Turner’s visit may have been in part inspired by the publication in 1818 of the evocative fourth canto of Byron’s “Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage”.Later characterized by John Ruskin as “a ghost upon the sands of the sea, so weak, so quiet, bereft of all but her loveliness,” Venice, with its seductive combination of evanescent luminosity, rich literary and artistic associations, and decaying grandeur, was an ideal subject for Turner, whose major preoccupations were the rise and fall of civilizations and the depiction of light (as he later remarked to Ruskin, “Atmosphere is my style” [Ruskin, “Works”, vol. 9, p. 17]). Yet, paradoxically, the “Glorious City in the Sea” was slow to captivate Turner’s imagination; after returning to England in 1820, he produced just one unfinished canvas of the Rialto and, aside from a few watercolors, did not turn his attention to the city again until 1833, when he exhibited two Venetian subjects at the Royal Academy. Turner returned later that year, and again in 1840, compulsively drawing (his three brief visits yielded over a thousand sketches), and produced Venetian canvasses and watercolors steadily between 1833 and the late 1840s.Turner was a virtuoso watercolorist, and the medium was particularly well suited to capturing Venice’s elusive and volatile atmospheric conditions. As Ian Warrell has demonstrated (2003, p. 171), this view of San Giorgio Maggiore and the Dogana is a sheet from the widely dispersed “Storm” sketchbook in use during Turner’s 1840 visit, which contained a series of finished watercolors charting the progress of a dramatic thunderstorm over Venice. As Warrell conjectures convincingly, Turner probably made the watercolors immediately on his return to the Europa Hotel after being caught in the storm.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Gillian Forrester","2007-01"
"5494","108","634516","2052","2","Turner was deeply interested in modern technology and particularly fascinated by steamboats, which appealed to him for both aesthetic and practical reasons. First introduced in Britain in 1801, the steamboat was established as a form of public transportation in 1812 and rapidly became widespread. Turner made frequent sketching tours in Britain and on the Continent, and the development of steam navigation enabled him to travel more widely and rapidly. The artist was often exercised by the problem of depicting “the wavy air, as some call the wind,” as he noted in one of his sketchbooks; the black smoke produced by steamboats, however, enabled Turner to track the movement of air currents in addition to offering a vehicle for articulating a new poetics of modernity (Taft, 2001). The steamship recurred frequently in Turner’s work from the early 1820s, often apparently celebrating technological progress, though appearing sinister or even demonic, and sometimes pitted against the forces of nature. Critics were initially skeptical about the appropriateness of steamboats as a subject for art, but by 1836 a writer in the “Quarterly Review” was praising Turner for introducing “a new instance of the beautiful” (Rodner, 1997, p. 45). In this drawing the steamer is shown sailing heroically in a menacing storm, the extremity of the weather underscored by Turner's bravura use of scratching out to denote the flash of lightning and the foam under the steamer’s paddles. Both the date and the subject of this bold and atmospheric watercolor are uncertain. Andrew Wilton has plausibly suggested that the location is the Lake of Lucerne (Wilton, “Turner”, 1980, p. 183); Judy Egerton has less convincingly connected the drawing to Turner’s 1830 visit to Staffa, and a third possibility is that the drawing is a view of the Lagoon and relates to his 1840 stay in Venice. Technically, the watercolor is similar to Turner’s work of the early 1840s, and this dating seems most likely.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Gillian Forrester","2007-01"
"5018","108","634524","2052","2","J.M.W. Turner had an affinity with the Scottish landscape, inspired by his deep admiration for the work of Sir Walter Scott. In 1831 he was commissioned by the Edinburgh publisher Robert Cadell to produce illustrations for an edition of Scott’s “Poetical Works”. After a memorable stay at Abbotsford with the ailing writer, who was to die the following year, Turner traveled north to Tobermory, where he boarded a steamer bound for the remote island of Staffa. Described by Scott as “one of the most extraordinary places I ever beheld,” Staffa was celebrated for its purplish-gray basaltic formations and enigmatic cavernous spaces; Fingal’s Cave, named for the Ossianic hero, was a particular object of pilgrimage for the Romantic tourist. According to Turner’s much later account, he was caught in a wild storm; upon his return to London, he commemorated his memorable voyage, choosing the moment when the sun “getting through the horizon, burst through the rain-cloud, angry” to create an extraordinarily compelling enactment of an encounter between man, symbolized by the steamship, and the unbridled forces of nature (Turner, “Correspondence”, p. 209).In the spring of 1832 Turner exhibited “Staffa” to critical acclaim; by coincidence, Felix Mendelssohn’s “Isles of Fingal” (later retitled “Die Hebriden”) was first performed in London on 14 May of that year, though to a considerably cooler reception. Staffa remained in Turner’s studio until 1845, when it was purchased by C. R. Leslie for five hundred pounds, on behalf of the New York collector Colonel James Lenox and thus became the first painting by Turner to be sent to America. Lenox was initially displeased with his purchase, complaining that it looked “indistinct,” but Turner recommended wiping the surface of the painting, suspecting that the varnish had bloomed during its transit across the Atlantic (Butlin and Joll, 1984, p. 199). This simple solution seems to have satisfied Lenox, who went on to acquire Turner’s “Fort Vimieux” (private collection), though he was unsuccessful in persuading the recalcitrant artist to sell him the “Fighting Temeraire” (National Gallery, London), despite offering the then astronomic sum of five thousand pounds.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Gillian Forrester","2007-01"
"5029","108","634528","7020","2","Gainsborough’s landscapes from his late Bath period are highly structured, although they radiate a sense of ease and naturalness. After years of creating what appeared to be fresh and unmediated visions of the English landscape, in the early 1770s Gainsborough began to paint and draw formally composed meditations on the idyll of rustic life, consciously mimicking the landscape precepts of the seventeenth-century painter Claude Lorrain. Hence, in this painting, our eye moves from the darker foreground figures shaded by a grove of trees and follows the winding river and arching bridge in the middle distance out to a background featuring a town bathed in a glowing evening light.A drawing related to “Landscape with Cattle” in the collection of the Yale Center for British Art suggests that Gainsborough carefully worked out some of his paintings at this time through the medium of drawing, experimenting with minute compositional shifts that would have a great impact on the nature of the finished work. The three cows are grouped more statically in the Center’s drawing than in the finished painting. It is generally thought that Gainsborough produced only rough sketches for his paintings, preferring to work out compositions as he painted. However, the fact that he had only recently begun painting landscapes of this kind, which would have demanded a more rigorous working method, argues for the supposition that the Center’s drawing preceded “Landscape with Cattle”.

With its English ballad interludes and its setting in London's criminal underworld, the play challenged the vogue for Italian opera that Hogarth had satirized in his earliest engravings.Hogarth’s painting depicts the climax of the play, set in Newgate Prison. Macheath, a gentlemanly highwayman bigamist, stands in chains at center stage. His two wives, Polly Peachum and Lucy Lockit, make appeals to their fathers, thieftaker and jailer, respectively, to perjure themselves in support of Macheath. Hogarth painted five versions of the scene; this is the last and marks the culmination of his rapid development as a painter.The painting is set in an ambiguous space, part prison and part stage, which situates the interplay of reality and fiction suggested in the Latin motto that appears on the banner over the stage: “Veluti in speculum” (as in a mirror). The figures seated in boxes at the sides of the stage, occupying what were considered to be the best seats in the house, are recognizable portraits. Of particular note are John Gay, the shadowy figure at the foot of the staircase, and John Rich, standing immediately in front of Gay. In the foreground, Lavinia Fenton, the actress playing Polly Peachum, meets the gaze of the enthralled Lord Bolton; at the end of the season he would install her as his mistress, and they would remain together until his death in 1754.“The Beggar's Opera” was Hogarth’s first major success as a painter and set the stage thematically and compositionally for the modern moral subjects he would begin to produce in the following decade.

"5009","108","634532","6799","2","This is one of the earliest in a long series of paintings of exotic animals, many of which Stubbs produced for his friends William and John Hunter, the Scottish anatomists and men of science. Stubbs may have met John Hunter in connection with the procurement of cadavers that the older, more socially established, and more medically experienced William dissected for his pupils and other interested people in the basement of his London town house. We do not know why Stubbs painted Queen Charlotte’s zebra, or African “she-ass,” nor why the painting was still in his studio at his death, but it has long been presumed that access to the animal was arranged by William Hunter, who served regularly as accoucheur to the queen.This was in fact the first zebra to be seen in England. It was brought from South Africa in 1762 by Sir Thomas Adams, the commanding officer of H.M.S. Terpsichore, as a gift from the governor for young Queen Charlotte. Two live specimens were dispatched from the Cape of Good Hope in what Malcolm Warner has described as “Noah's-ark fashion,” but only the female survived the voyage. As soon as she reached London, the zebra was installed in the menagerie at Buckingham House (Buckingham Palace) and became an instant celebrity. “The Queen's she-ass,” wrote one observer, “was pestered with visits, and had all her hours employed from morning to night in satisfying the curiosity of the public. She had a sentinel and guard placed at the door of her stable. . . . The crowds that resorted to the Asinine palace were exceeding great,” (MacClintock, 1992, p. 4). In fact, she also inspired a number of rude songs—including this one that circulated in broadsheets:Ye Bucks and ye Jemmies who amble the Park,Whose Hearts and whose Heads are as lightsome    as Cork,Through “Buckingham Gate”, as to “Chelsea” you pass,Without Fee or Reward, you may see the Q---‘s A--.“See the Q---‘s A--. See the Q---'s A--,Without Fee or Reward”, &amp;c.(The Queen’s Ass. a new humorous allegorical song . . . By H. Howard, To the Tune of “Stick a Pin There”. Broadsheet, British Museum)Stubbs’s grasp of the anatomical differences between zebras and horses is, of course, masterly, and in the present work the backward direction of the ears, the dewlap on the underside of the neck or the front, and the “gridiron” pattern of the stripes on the nether regions, immediately above the tail—all these are exactly consistent with zoological verisimilitude and, in fact, identify the present animal as the smallest of three subspecies of zebra, the Cape Mountain. “The Queen's Ass” survived until 3 April 1773, perhaps in spite of sharing its accommodation in due course with an elephant and being moved to the Tower of London.

"5040","108","634548","7020","2","Despite its small size—it measures less than twenty-seven inches across—Benjamin West’s “The Artist and His Family” is a forceful statement of personal and professional ambition. The “neat little scene of domestic happiness,” as it was called by the “Morning Chronicle” (25 April 1777) was probably painted with the express purpose of serving as a modello for an engraving published by Boydell in 1779. Dedicated to Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia, the print—as well as the lofty references to religious art in “The Artist and His Family”—indicates the scope of West’s ambitions to be known internationally as a history and portrait painter through the calling card of this seemingly modest family picture.The painting marks two generative events: the birth of West’s second child and the reunion of the American and British members of the West family. After Benjamin West settled in London, his English-born father, John, returned from America for the first time in nearly fifty years. There, John met his long-lost son Thomas, shown as a man of fifty-six seated next to his white-haired father. This earlier reunion between John and Thomas—both practicing Quakers, as indicated by their costume—is echoed in the 1772 gathering, in which grandfather and uncle call to see the newest member of the West family.Jules Prown has referred to “The Artist and His Family” as “a nativity in Hammersmith,” denoting the sacred aura that infuses this domestic scene, probably painted at the artist’s villa near the Thames in Hammersmith (Prown, 2002, p. 117). Betsy West, cradling her child in her lap, is a secular Madonna, visited by two magi in the forms of John and Thomas West.

"5035","108","634549","7020","2","In this portrait of George and Mary Browne and their five eldest children, Francis Wheatley has turned the conventions of the conversation piece upside down. The Browne family engage in the fashionable pursuits dictated by eighteenth-century ideals of polite behavior, but with a twist. It is Mr. Browne, Principal Clerk of the Westminster Fire Office insurance company, who serenely sketches by the lakeside, a traditionally female activity in conversation pieces. His wife, hitching up her skirt to reveal a bright pink petticoat, has confidently cast out her line and snared a catch, which her son George unhooks for her. Mrs. Browne’s confident stance—hand on hip—is a variation on the pose made famous by Anthony Van Dyck in his dashing male portraits. This reversal of traditional gender roles adds a layer of narrative interest missing from so many conversation pieces, in which the sitters are arranged in a monotonous friezelike manner. The Brownes are pushed to the right side of the canvas; more than half of the picture surface is given over to the depiction of the landscape that these Londoners temporarily inhabit. In the distance we see a humble thatched dwelling, suggestive of the cottagers and peasants who would become Wheatley’s dominant subject matter later in his career.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Cassandra Albinson","2007-01"
"5508","108","634620","2052","2","Of all the British landscape artists of the Romantic period, Turner was the most fascinated by modernity, and many of his images chronicle technological advances. While touring Yorkshire in 1816 to gather material for Thomas Dunham Whitaker’s “The History of Yorkshire”, Turner visited Leeds, the hub of the nation’s wool and flax industries, and made meticulous graphite sketches of the city, which he elaborated into this watercolor on his return to London. Turner’s remarkable drawing celebrates the economic success and resilience of Leeds—and by extension, that of Britain—in the immediate aftermath of the wars with Napoleon. As Stephen Daniels has noted in his penetrating analysis of the watercolor, to which this entry is indebted, Turner’s image is a complex and richly allusive portrayal of a rapidly developing industrial city, an amalgam of sources rather than a straightforward topographical record (Daniels, 1986, 1993).The watercolor, which depicts the city from Beeston Hill, about a mile and half south of the city, draws on the conventions of the prospect or panorama, a well-established genre for representing urban development and prosperity. Daniels has suggested convincingly that Turner used two eighteenth-century sources, Samuel Buck’s 1720 engraved prospect of Leeds and an allegorical poem by John Dyer, “The Fleece”, which details the processes of wool manufacture and offers a vision of Britain united through labor. With similar patriotic intention, though perhaps not without ambivalence, Turner mapped the smoky industrial landscape of Leeds, placing John Marshall’s flax mill at the center of his composition and carefully differentiating its figures’ occupations—tentermen hanging cloth to dry, masons, milk carriers, and a millworker carrying a roll of cloth. It is likely that Turner intended “Leeds” to be engraved for Whitaker's publication, but it was not included, perhaps because its industrial subject matter was considered unsuitable for this somewhat conservative publication. The watercolor was published in 1823, translated, appropriately, into the modern medium of lithography.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Gillian Forrester","2007-01"
"5832","108","634638","7112","2","Dr. Johnson thought the acid test of fitness was climbing to the top of the exhibition staircase at Somerset House without stopping (Samuel Johnson to William Heberden, 13 Oct. 1784, in Redford, 1994, p. 418). This stairway was designed by Sir William Chambers and led the way to the Great Room, where the Royal Academy held its annual exhibitions. Although the Academy promoted them as “easy and convenient,” the stairs became notorious (Baretti, 1781, p. 15). Owing to the cramped site, Chambers squeezed three continuous flights of stairs into a semicircular space. The unhappy result was a vertiginous staircase, the final flight of which was the steepest and narrowest. While Chambers hoped to make climbing the staircase a metaphor for the ascent of Parnassus, Rowlandson depicts an angry altercation at the top of the stairs and a rampant dog wreaking havoc lower down. To the horror of some onlookers and delight of others, the ladies trip and tumble headlong down the stairs, their skirts flying. The right-hand niche is occupied by a smiling Callipygian Venus, the goddess who admires her own beautiful posterior. By joking about the kind of beauties the exhibition visitors really want to see, Rowlandson also mocks the elevated pretensions of the Academy itself. In this satire, Rowlandson demonstrates the superior appeal of real bodies as opposed to the idealized works of art on view upstairs. Not only does this allude to Hogarth’s famous dictum “who but a bigot, even to the antiques, will say that he has not seen faces and necks, hands and arms in living women that even the Grecian Venus doth but coarsely imitate,” but the composition also embodies Hogarth’s famously anti-academic “Line of Beauty” (Hogarth, “Analysis of Beauty”, p. 66). Unsurprisingly, some have detected Rowlandson borrowing from Last Judgment imagery in these chaotic, tumbling figures (Sitwell, 1937, p. 15). Rather than a dignified ascent of Parnassus, as Chambers intended, Rowlandson suggests a comic equivalent of the descent into hell.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Matthew Hargraves","2007-01"

The exercise of creating these two paintings drew on the talents of imaginative projection that Canaletto had honed in his “capricci”, or fantastical representations of ruined buildings and crumbling tombs.When Lord Brooke returned from his Grand Tour, he decided that Warwick Castle, his ancestoral home, needed to be brought up to the standards of the fashion of the eighteenth century. His first two interventions, the gleaming white Gothic-style windows on the second story of the castle and the new Gothic porch on the left side of the building, are clearly indicated in the Center’s painting. Next to the porch we see a listing lean-to shed with tools stacked against it, an indication of the building site that Warwick would soon become. Workers toil on the beginning stages of the massive landscaping of the castle park that Brooke had commissioned from Lancelot “Capability” Brown, the renowned landscape designer. In the Thyssen-Bornemisza picture this area is shown planted with picturesque groupings of trees, as the artist imagined it would appear after the implementation of Brown’s design. The two pictures also diverge in the depiction of Castle Meadow, the area in the foreground crisscrossed by the river Avon. In the Center’s picture, elegant couples, gentlemen fishing, and a nursemaid with an infant enjoy the meadow at their leisure. The mill along the river and the young boys scrambling over a fence in the right corner of the painting are reminders of the intense relationship between the town of Warwick and the castle. In the Thyssen-Bornemisza picture the mill is gone, replaced by a private pleasure barge, and the number of figures on the lawn is truncated. The park of Warwick Castle would be a private retreat rather than a public promenade after Brooke’s remodeling. Canaletto’s appealing paintings were instrumental in this process of renovation and reimagination, and Brooke commissioned a total of five paintings of Warwick Castle from the artist.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Cassandra Albinson","2007-01"
"5620","108","697943","2052","2","Thomas Rowlandson's popular reputation as a perceptive and gently mocking-if rarely overtly satirical-commentator on eighteenth-century social life has tended to detract from our appreciation of his extraordinary talents as a draftsman and colorist. Rowlandson's lively portrait of the two celebrated socialites, Georgina, Duchess of Deonshire (1757-1806), and her sister Harriet (1761-1821), demonstrates the refinement and facility characteristic of his drawing style, qualities which are all the more remarkable given his prodigious output (the Center alone owns more than four hundred watercolors by Rowlandson). Georgina, Duchess of Devonshire, epitomized the extravagant modus operandi of the aristocracy in late eighteenth-century England. Married at the age of seventeen to William, 5th Duke of Devonshire, she became a celebrated society hostess, renowned for her cutting edge sartorial sense and notorious for her love-affairs and unregenerate addiction to gambling. Georgina also played an influential role in political life with her active promotion of the Whig cause. Her month once remarked caustically: ""Without being handsome or having a single feature in her face [she is] one of the most showy girls I ever saw,"" but like her sister Harriet, Georgina was considered a great beauty, and the two women's legendary vivacity and charm are vividly conveyed in Rowlandson's drawing. Georgina, who is depicted holding a sheet of music, seems to have been a talented musician; she played the harp, and in 1799 the song she wrote for Richard Brinsley Sheridan's tragedy Pizzaro became a success in its own right. The sisters also appear prominently in Rowlandson's evocation of fashionable life, Vauxhall Gardens (cat. 87). ","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Gillian Forrester","2001-05"
"5870","108","698251","1252","2","By the end of the end of the eighteenth century, Thomas Girtin and J.M.W. Turner had elevated landscape painting in watercolors to a new level of sophistication and laid the groundwork for the Romantic landscape painting of the new century. Although Girtin would die only two years into that new century, Turner would go on to build on those foundations one of the greatest achievements of British art.In the early 1790s both Turner and Girtin were young topographical artists in training. Girtin was apprenticed to Edward Dayes in 1789. As part of his apprenticeship, he, along with Dayes, worked up in pencil sketches made by the linen draper and antiquarian James Moore on his tours. The Yale Center for British Art has two volumes of Moore's sketches from a tout of Scotland and the north of England in 1792, as well as several watercolors by both Dayes and Girtin based on sketches in the volumes. In the same yea that Girtin was apprenticed to Dayes, Turned began working in the studio of Thomas Malton and entered the Royal Academy Schools. Turner sent his first watercolor to the Royal Academy exhibition the following year. In 1793, he exhibited a watercolor of the ""Gate of St. Augustine's Monastery, Canterbury."" Although the evidence is not conclusive, this would appear to be a work now untraced; however, it is possible that the work exhibited at the Royal Academy is cat. 144. Another smaller watercolor version of the composition is also in the Yale Center for British Art. In 1794 turner and Girtin were working together copying drawing by John Robert Cozens and Thomas Hearne at the ""academy"" that Dr. Thomas Monro held at his home in the Adelphi Terrace in the evenings. Monro, a specialist in mental disorders, was looking after Cozens following his mental breakdown early in 1794 and had access to Cozen's studio. That same year Girtin exhibited his watercolors for the first time at the Royal Academy, and in the autumn he accompanied James Moore on a tour of the Midlands. The watercolor of Litchfield Cathedral, deriving from the tour, was exhibited at the Royal Academy the following year and bought from the exhibition by Moore. While it is still very much indebted to the Dayes style, it has a drama, achieved largely though the play of light and shadow across the forms of the cathedral, that shows that he had learned from the example of Cozen's watercolors. Turner too learned from Cozens the light that plays across St. Augustine's gate in Turner's watercolor of approximately the same date has a similar dramatic character. Indeed Girtin's Litchfield Cathedral and Turner's St. Augustine's Gate demonstrate how close stylistically these two young colleagues and rivals were at this early point in their careers.

Dissatisfied with existing lunar cartography, he used his skills of observation and pictorial representation to produce moon-maps which were highly praised by his scientific contemporaries. Russell was encouraged in his endeavors by Sir Joseph Banks, President of the Royal Society, who advocated having lunar maps drawn by artists rather than astronomers. Using a six-foot reflecting telescope with a six-inch mirror made by the astronomer Sir William Herschel and a refracting Dolland telescope, Russell made a large number of detailed working sketches, which he annotated with notes, using John Bryom's system of shorthand.

While not an architect himself, Chatelain's role in depicting and disseminating architecture to a larger public was an important part of the architectural practice, as it raised public awareness of architectural styles and important structures. The gardens at Stowe, the home of Richard Temple, Viscount Cobham, were a subject of popular interest because of their reconstruction throughout the early eighteenth century by Temple and Charles Bridgeman.

Chatelain presents the landscape at Stowe as pastoral and idyll; framed by the Ionic columns of the rotunda on the left and the majestic trees on the right, diminutive picturesque workers rest or assume classical poses. This view would change drastically soon afterward, as the monument and canal in the distance as well as surrounding trees, were removed to provide a central vista from the garden façade of the house.

"8041","108","698277","1252","2","Marine drawing in eighteenth-century Britain was largely a specialized production aimed at an expert audience. The marine draftsman was required to provide a documentary record of ships, naval engagements, harbors, and coastlines for a knowledgeable public of active and retired seamen. As John Thomas Serres (cats. 72-3) observed in his Liber Nauticus and Instructor in the Art of Marine Drawing (1805), proficiency in the art demanded both a working knowledge both of the construction of ships, what Serres termed ""naval architecture,"" and of seamanship. Consequently, it was common for the marine draftsman or painter to have turned to art after an actual involvement in the building or sailing of ships. Like his father and his twin brother, Robert Cleveley became a marine painter after working in the Royal Dockyard at Deptford. The Scottish-born William Anderson was likewise a shipwright before becoming an artist. John Harris, like the Cleveleys, grew up in the neighborhood of the Deptford dockyard. His boyhood surrondings inspired an early interest in shipbuilding, manifested in the building of a model sloop, though apparently not in any actual employment in the shipbuilding trade. As an artist, Harris pursued marine drawings as but one of several specializations. He worked as a book designer and illustrator and natural-history draftsman.With its documentary nature the marine watercolor of the period was the nautical equivalent, in both function and technique, of the topographical watercolor. The combination of precise pen outlines and delicate washes of color that characterize the ""stained"" or ""tinted"" drawings of the topographical tradition was equally well-suited to the depiction of ships and rigging. Robert Cleveley's brother John studied with the topographical artist Paul Sandby, who was one of a number of watercolorists employed by naval and military schools to teach their young cadets the art of drawing.

As an interior decorator, he conceived decorative schemes as well as designing wallpaper, chimney pieces, carpets, and even silverware fro an array or aristocratic and fashionable clients such as cabinet maker and draftsman, he put both talents to use, although it is thought that he stopped personally executing his furniture designs after the 1750sThis design for a writing table appeared as Plate LI in Chippendale's important 1754 publication The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker's Director, consisting of ""most elegant and useful designs of household furniture in the most fashionable taste."" This influential publication was the first patter-book to consider a wide array of household furnishings, and it was unique in that it united the patron (the Gentleman of the title) with craftsman (the Cabinet-Maker) in a sense of shared endeavor: ""to assist the one [the patron] in Choice, and the other [the craftsman] in the execution of the Designs."" Echoing the accepted mode of architectural drawing, Chippendale provides the viewer with elevation, plan, and section of the writing table.The popularity of this volume made the name Chippendale into an adjective describing English rococo furniture.

The entrepreneurial tyers has the gardens embellished with walks, ruins, statues, Chinese pavilions, triumphal arches, and a ""Gothik"" orchestra, and his continuing program of improvements included several important art commissions, most notably Luis-François Roubiliac's celebrated statue of Handel, four patriotic modern history subjects by Francis Hayman, and an extensive sequence of decorative paintings designed for the supper-boxes by Hayman, and an extensive sequence of decorative paintings designed for the supper-boxes by Hayman and William Hogarth. Vauxhall was almost universally popular, despite (or because of it) its reputation for frivolity and moral laxity, and typified the egalitarian nature of British social life of the period. James Boswell, and inveterate commentator on metropolitan life observed:Vauxhall Gardens is peculiarly adapted to the taste of the English nation; there being a mixture of curious show - gay exhibition, musick, vocal and instrumental, not too refined for the general ear; - for all which only shilling paid.

"5476","108","698363","1252","2","By the end of the end of the eighteenth century, Thomas Girtin and J.M.W. Turner had elevated landscape painting in watercolors to a new level of sophistication and laid the groundwork for the Romantic landscape painting of the new century. Although Girtin would die only two years into that new century, Turner would go on to build on those foundations one of the greatest achievements of British art.In the early 1790s both Turner and Girtin were young topographical artists in training. Girtin was apprenticed to Edward Dayes in 1789. As part of his apprenticeship, he, along with Dayes, worked up in pencil sketches made by the linen draper and antiquarian James Moore on his tours. The Yale Center for British Art has two volumes of Moore's sketches from a tout of Scotland and the north of England in 1792, as well as several watercolors by both Dayes and Girtin based on sketches in the volumes. In the same yea that Girtin was apprenticed to Dayes, Turned began working in the studio of Thomas Malton and entered the Royal Academy Schools. Turner sent his first watercolor to the Royal Academy exhibition the following year. In 1793, he exhibited a watercolor of the ""Gate of St. Augustine's Monastery, Canterbury."" Although the evidence is not conclusive, this would appear to be a work now untraced; however, it is possible that the work exhibited at the Royal Academy is cat. 144. Another smaller watercolor version of the composition is also in the Yale Center for British Art. In 1794 turner and Girtin were working together copying drawing by John Robert Cozens and Thomas Hearne at the ""academy"" that Dr. Thomas Monro held at his home in the Adelphi Terrace in the evenings. Monro, a specialist in mental disorders, was looking after Cozens following his mental breakdown early in 1794 and had access to Cozen's studio. That same year Girtin exhibited his watercolors for the first time at the Royal Academy, and in the autumn he accompanied James Moore on a tour of the Midlands. The watercolor of Litchfield Cathedral, deriving from the tour, was exhibited at the Royal Academy the following year and bought from the exhibition by Moore. While it is still very much indebted to the Dayes style, it has a drama, achieved largely though the play of light and shadow across the forms of the cathedral, that shows that he had learned from the example of Cozen's watercolors. Turner too learned from Cozens the light that plays across St. Augustine's gate in Turner's watercolor of approximately the same date has a similar dramatic character. Indeed Girtin's Litchfield Cathedral and Turner's St. Augustine's Gate demonstrate how close stylistically these two young colleagues and rivals were at this early point in their careers.

A founding member of the Royal Academy, he was placed in charge of all government buildings in his capacity as Surveyor General of the Board Works (1782). In contrast to the baroque training and interests of Vanbrugh (cat. 110) and Gibbs (cat. 111), Chambers and the neoclassical architects of his generation looked to ancient Roman architecture and archaeological findings for inspiration. In 1759 Chambers published his Treatise on Civil Architecture, a volume devoted to ""sound precepts and good designs"" that considered for the most part, the decorative aspects of architecture such as doors and gateways. One of these ""good designs"" was a doorway by the Italian architect Palladio. In a practice common at the time, Chambers showed his skill and knowledge of classical forms by adapting Palladio's design in his own work, these gateways for Thomas Brand at his country home The Hoo. This drawing gives the viewer some indication of Chambers's working process, as he has noted the thickness of the wall and the projection of the architectural elements, while more technical drawings to the left of each gateway explain the proportions and construction methods. Placed side by side , these two gateways illustrate the diversity of his practice.

Lord Bute, director of the project, planned to create a scientific botanic garden amid this royal retreat in the Surrey countryside new greenhouses were built, existing buildings were moved, and Chambers set about designing new garden structures in a variety of architectural styles. Although it was never built due to financial concerns on the part of the patroness, the Temple of Peace was planned as part of an excursion through the classical themes and motifs in a garden that presented a tour of world d architecture, including Chamber's celebrated Chinese-style Pagoda.

The Ionic columns would have echoed those of the diminutive temple of Arethusa, located nearby, while the sculpted pediment and entablature surpassed it in grandeur. In 1763 Chambers recorded his involvement in the redesign of Kew Gardens with the publication of Plans, Elevations, Sections, and Perspective Views of the Gardens and Buildings at Kew in Surry, and he remained architect there until the death of Princess Augusta in 1772.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Morna O'Neill","2001-05"

The Geographers, originally a sheet in one of Brown's Roman sketch-books, suggests something of the intense intellectual climate he experienced there and also reflects the preoccupation with the supernatural and uncanny themes that informed the work of Fuseli and his circle. The drawing also demonstrates Brown's fascination with physiognomy, a theoretical system dating back to the Renaissance and based on the premise that facial expressions were an index to human personality. Brown may have become interested in the subject through his association with Fuseli, who made several drawings for Johann Kasper Lavater's influential treatise, Essays on Physiognomy, Calculated to Extend the Knowledge and the Love of Mankind. The young man seated nearest the viewer in Brown's drawing has a classical profile, in physiognomonic terms indicative of nobility of character, whereas the hooked noses and scowling expressions of the standing men hint at the villainous nature. Brown, who made numerous drawings of heads, was described by one of his contemporaries as having ""a peculiar talent in delineating the human physiognomy which he prosecuted with utmost diligence and perseverance, frequently following a remarkable character day after day until he completely succeeded in obtaining his resemblance and character.""

He soon began designing and executing garden sculptures, including a life-size marble figure of Palladio for Lord Burlington, portrait busts, and funerary monuments. This monument, completed by Rysbrack and installed in Westminster Abbey, commemorates Admiral Vernon, who served in the West Indies during the reign of George II. Elaborate funerary monuments were the preserve of the wealthy, often regardless of rank or accomplishments, and they earned the stern words of moralists of the age. Joseph Addison saw these monuments as a futile attempt to defy ""that great day when we shall all of us be contemporaries, and make our Appearance together."" The monument for Admiral Vernon takes advantage of Rysbrack's renowned skill and innovation with portrait busts. The winged figure of fame crowns an idealized bust of the admiral in classical dress by the sculptor. Drawing occupied an important p[lace in the working process of the sculptor as well as the painter and architect.

The multi talented actor-manager and theatre proprietor David Garrick astutely recognized the value of portraits for promoting individual actors and productions, and he played a leading role in the development of the theatrical conversation piece. John Downman's drawing portrays John Edwin and Mary Wells in their roles as Lingo and Cowslip in John O'Keeffe's three-act comedy, The Agreeable Surprise. The play was immensely successful, and between its opening at the Haymarket Theatre, London, in 1781 and 1800 it was performed more than 200 times. The comic actor John Edwin (1749-90) made his first professional appearance in 1775 and was most famous for his role as Lingo. Edwin was as celebrated for his singing as his acting; according to the manager-playwright, George Colman, ""While he sung in a style which produced roars of laughter, there was a melody in some of the upper tones of his voice that was beautiful."" The inscription on the original frame is somewhat misleading, since at least eighteen engraved portraits of Edwin after various artists are known. Mary Wells, née Davies (c. 1759-before 1826), was born in Birmingham and preformed in regional theaters before making her London acting debut in 1781. Constantly in debt and involved in amorous intrigue, the raffish actress conformed to the popular notion of her profession as dissolute and unrespectable, an image which the many portraits of Garrick - who assiduously cultivated himself as a model of social propriety - strove to contradict.

He toured prisons throughout the Continent, finally dying in Russia in 1790 from a fever contracted during one of his prison visits. Howard had declined to be painted by Romney in 1785; but after Howard's death, Romney set to work on what he hoped would be a series of paintings celebrating Howard's heroic efforts in alleviating human misery. In the early 1790s Romney produced a series of powerful drawings of nightmarish prison scenes in which Howard's experiences are transmuted into universal images of anguish and despair. Although Romney was one of the most fashionable society portrait painters of eighteenth-century England, success in the area of art he most valued - history painting - eluded him. As with so many of his other ambitious plans for history paintings, his projected paintings of Howard visiting prisons never progressed beyond these drawings.On August 2, 1786, a mentally disturbed woman named Margaret Nicholson tried to stab George III; the monarch, escaping unharmed, pardoned his assailant, who was confined to Bethlehem Hospital. Dighton's drawing is a piece of visual reportage, attempting to convey the actual appearance of the attempted assassination. For Dighton, the son of a printseller and himself a caricaturist and printseller, topicality and timeliness were of the essence.

Thomas Rowlandson's watercolor draws on a number of stereotypes commonly associated with the French at this period - the suppositious adherence to the Catholic faith, indicated by the procession of monks and the looming presence of Notre-Dame (flaunting topographical accuracy, Rowlandson has placed the cathedral immediately behind Place de Victoires); an unquestioning devotion to the monarchy, signaled by the man in the sedan chair gazing raptly at the monument erected to Louis XIV in 1686; and a frivolous attachment to sartorial sonsiderations, represented by the fashionably dressed figures and the poodle dog wearing a wig. Two other versions of the composition are known, but it is likely that cat. 86 was the original watercolor exhibited by Rowlandson at the Society of Artists in 1783. The image was engraved and published in Britain shortly after the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, presumably in response to the considerable public interest generated by the tumultuous events in France.Rowlandson clearly derived pleasure from ridiculing the French and produced many watercolors on this theme, but his relationship with France seems to have been more complex than his John Bullish stance might suggest. Raised by his French-speaking aunt Jane (née Chevalier), Rowlandson visited the country on a number of occasions, and his sophisticated and refined drawing style, which often seems at odds with his robust subject matter, owes much to French rococo art.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Gillian Forrester","2001-05"

The objects stand out as gigantic, inexplicable presences and yet are deeply rooted in the landscape. In Mineral Objects they are pieces of bituminous shale called ‘coal money’ from Kimmeridge in Dorset.

"11590","108","634259","2052","2","The portrait miniature is associated particularly with the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but this distinctive form of drawing retained its appeal throughout the eighteenth century and indeed increased in popularity as a middle-class clientele for portraits evolved. Although portrait miniatures were exhibited publicly later in the century (at the Royal Academy they were prominently displayed around the fireplace in the Great Room), they were generally, though not invariably, intended for private rather than public use. Usually commissioned to commemorate births, marriages, friendships, love affairs, or dynastic relationships—though sometimes made as copies of large-scale portraits—these tiny delicate likenesses were often housed in specially crafted cases made of precious materials and either worn as jewelry or stored in cabinets with other images of loved ones.As Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s concept of “natural” and close family relationships became increasingly influential toward the end of the century, this most private form of portraiture, like the family conversation piece, gained in popularity. Because of the inherently personal and private nature of miniatures, the identities of sitters have often been lost over the centuries, particularly when the objects have left the original owners and entered museum collections; this sense of loss adds a particular resonance and poignancy to these commemorative images. The exact identity of the sitter of this exquisite miniature is uncertain, but the inscription records that it represents a “Miss Blunt.” According to his fee books, George Engleheart painted fifteen miniatures of members of the family of Sir Charles William Blunt between 1785 and 1812; on the basis of style and costume, the miniature can be dated to circa 1795–1800, and it most likely depicts Blunt’s third daughter, Elizabeth (d. 1839), who married her second cousin Sir Charles Burrell Blunt in 1801 and is recorded in Engleheart’s fee book as having sat for the artist in 1796 and 1800.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Gillian Forrester","2007-01"
"11603","108","634260","9448","2","The identities of both the sitter and artist for this miniature, who were traditionally thought to be Elizabeth, daughter of James I and later Queen of Bohemia, and Isaac Oliver, respectively, were debated and revised in the twentieth century. Graham Reynolds reattributed the work to Nicholas Hilliard in 1947, a revision that remains unchallenged, and Erna Auerbach unequivocally stated that comparison of this portrait with those authenticated as Princess Elizabeth make the original identification unsupportable. The miniature of the princess by Isaac Oliver, in the Center's collection, also offers a markedly different image. Indeed, the brightly colored gown, open stance, and flowing, seemingly wind-tossed hair of the sitter give a life and vividness to the work that differs markedly from most other miniatures identified as Princess Elizabeth, which show her in stiff formal splendor, with her hair dressed high on her head.Reynolds places “Portrait of a Lady” among a series of portraits of women with loose, flowing hair done by Hilliard circa 1605-10, which both he and Auerbach count as some of the artist's finest work in his later years. This miniature, and the pattern miniature of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, by Hilliard’s talented pupil Isaac Oliver, both passed from Horace Walpole's splendid collection to that of the 13th Earl of Derby.

"11628","108","634261","9448","2","This portrait, likely done from life, of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex (1566–1601), appears to have been deliberately left unfinished. The painstaking execution of the face, hair, and beard and the shadowy sketching of the upper body suggest that it was painted as a pattern for replication. That its purpose was well served is testified to by several existing versions in museum and private collections, including the Royal Collection, the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and the National Portrait Gallery, London.It is not surprising that the Earl of Essex commissioned such a work. Essex’s ambitions centered on renown as a soldier and leader in the Protestant cause and as a spiritual successor to Sir Philip Sidney. Elizabeth’s favor brought him into court circles after 1587 as master of the horse and her preferred companion. His insistence on pursuing his ideals, however, often in defiance of politic behavior, brought Essex into disfavor with the queen more than once, and his ambitions to rival the Cecil family in political leadership also created tensions. In these struggles, Essex frequently utilized the public forum to circulate his ideas and strengthen his position, issuing printed and manuscript propaganda. His portraits, over his lifetime, also suggest the conscious molding of an image of strength and prowess, and later of statesmanlike qualities. At approximately the time Oliver created this miniature, Essex was seeking to become Elizabeth’s chief councillor, the better to promote the cause of Protestant war. The dating of the miniature to a time when Essex was still promoting his triumph over the Spanish in the Cádiz expedition and before his fall from grace in 1598 is suggested by his distinctive beard, which features in Marcus Gheeraerts’s Cádiz portrait (Woburn Abbey), and the ribbon of the garter, combined with a sober doublet and fancy collar. Such a combination reminds the viewer of the earl's martial leadership, while presenting a somber yet courtly mien and dress suitable to a political leader.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Lisa Ford","2007-01"
"11650","108","634262","2052","2","Smart's restrained and meticulous style of portraiture seems to have been particularly appealing to men, and he received a considerable number of commissions from military officers. In 1785, capitalizing on the commercial opportunities offered by the British presence in India, he set up a portrait studio in Madras, where his sitters included members of the British army as well as famous local figures including the Nawab of Arcot and the captive sons of Tippoo Sultan. Smart may have met James Stevenson in Madras, though this miniature is dated 1796, the year after the artist's return to London. The toughness implicit in Smart's austere portrait, mitigated only by the hint of a sardonic smile, is borne out by the sitter's military career. Stevenson was second in command to Arthur Wellesley, later the Duke of Wellington, during Wellesley's campaign against the Marathas in India in 1802-3. He played an important role in the decisive Battle of Assaye on 24 September 1803, which Wellesley's troops won against considerable odds and with enormous casualties.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Gillian Forrester","2007-01"
"9630","108","634268","7020","2","This may well be a drawing of one of the so-called foregrounds in miniature that Gainsborough constructed out of stones, mosses, and mirrors in his Bath studio. He assembled and then sketched these miniature tabletop landscapes as a means of composing the feathery trees, gnarled stumps, rocky outcroppings, and pools of water that appear in his landscapes, portraits, and genre scenes. Gainsborough was also, however, devoted to the practice of drawing the motif directly from nature. The painter Ozias Humphry, a neighbor of Gainsborough’s in Bath, recalled that the two artists would often take afternoon sketching excursions into the countryside (Hayes and Stainton, 1983, p. 9).Whatever the mechanics of the creation of this drawing, it demonstrates a change in style and technique that evolved during his Bath period. Previously, the artist had drawn mostly with pencils. In the 1760s the ever-inventive and experimental Gainsborough began to make mixed-media drawings with watercolor, chalk, oil paint, and gum arabic, among other things. Combining these materials allowed him to achieve dramatic chiaroscuro and texture in his works on paper. Here, he emphasizes the rock in the middle distance, touching it with white paint and a dash of acidic green suggestive of moss or lichen in tone and texture.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Cassandra Albinson","2007-01"
"12902","108","634269","9450","2","The present drawing, believed to have been in Horace Walpole’s collection at Strawberry Hill, was made shortly after Wyck’s arrival in London in 1663 (the pagoda-shaped water house shown here was demolished in 1664). In the distance, at the right of the composition, is Old St. Paul’s, which would soon be consumed in the Great Fire of 1666. Wyck’s use of gray wash, a technique he is credited with popularizing—if not introducing—among English artists, gives this view contrasts and shadows.Wyck’s English compositions, like those of Claesz Janz. Visscher and Wenceslaus Hollar, are witness to a changing urban landscape. Apart from their own artistic merits and aesthetic qualities, these works have historical significance. Wyck has recorded vistas of a city that was undergoing—or about to see—major transformations. The Great Fire was a defining moment for all Londoners, artists included: for those fortunate enough to have been spared its destruction, the event gave a temporal standpoint from which it became possible to designate a before and after cityscape. Wyck’s particular interest in this event and its aftermath is demonstrated by several of his works, such as a “View of London Before the Great Fire” (collection of the Duke of Devonshire), a drawing showing the Newgate Prison surrounded by plumes of smoke (Paul Mellon Collection, ycba), and sketches depicting the Ruins of Old St Paul's (Wakefield Collection and Bodleian Library).","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Stephane Roy","2007-01"

The pagoda at Lin-Ching-Shih stood at the point where the Eu-Ho River intersects with the Grand Canal. Alexander saw and sketched it from the junk in which he traveled up the Eu-Ho and along the entire length of the Grand Canal, from Beijing to Hangchow. Although he had little opportunity for excursions beyond the riverbanks, the month-long voyage provided him with plentiful opportunity to observe waterside life. Alexander made a number of drawings of the Chinese people who gathered to watch the Europeans passing and used these sketches to populate his finished watercolors. This watercolor is one of five versions of the scene that Alexander produced on his return to England and may be the one that was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1796 under the title ""Pagoda near Lin-tchin-four"" (no. 690).

All four pictures are of similar format and finish and are linked by their musical theme. Although no printed version has yet been identified, it is possible that Burney may have intended to publish them, but they may also have been created for the amusement of his private circle.“The Triumph of Music” depicts the type of musical group to which the Burney family belonged, a group of gentlemen (and sometimes ladies) who met to sing, eat, and drink together. Specifically, it refers to types of songs popular during the period; the numerous inscriptions are the titles of catches, canons, glees, and rounds. Glees in particular are characterized by their double, sometimes obscene meanings and the repetition of words or fragments of words. Here, the formal attributes of the picture echo the structures of glee and canon singing: the figures of the three old women on the right, for example, are repeated in the three young women on the left, and salacious visual puns abound.

"8721","108","634273","7112","2","In the 1770s Cozens developed a treatise on landscape painting titled “The Various Species of Landscape Composition, in Nature”. Although the text is lost, we know he intended to argue that landscape compositions could convey feelings and ideas simply through the arrangement of forms. According to this theory, ideal landscapes could carry serious moral messages of the kind traditionally reserved to history painting (Rosenthal, 1993, p. 20). Although “Mountainous Landscape” does not match any of the designs in “The Various Species”, it is a purely imaginary composition that contains various stock elements found in Cozens’s classification of landscape scenery. The ideas Cozens associated with such landscapes could be esoteric, but here the barren mountain rising suddenly from a fertile plane evokes the awesome power of the sublime. He undoubtedly appreciated Edmund Burke's “Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful” (1757), which had argued that viewing awesome prospects like mountains inspired a thrilling sense of terror; Cozens concurred, believing that mountain prospects inspired “surprise, terror, superstition, silence, melancholy, power, strength” (Sloan, 1986, p. 56). One of Cozens’s pupils noted in 1781 that “he has for several years exhibited to the public, pictures of landscapes; attempting to perform them in the third degree of taste, that is the sublime” (unknown author, 1781, cited in Whitley, 1928, vol. 2, p. 319). The exclusion of color from Cozens's palette further distances this drawing from imitation of nature by forcing the viewer to focus on the landscape's formal properties. Similarly it is entirely devoid of human life, giving the landscape a universal significance rather than tying it to any particular time or place. Although Cozens earned a reputation as a blotter, his technique for finished drawings was a carefully controlled blend of fluid washes and hatched strokes, an approach perhaps influenced by the work of the English-based French engraver François Vivares (Wilton, “Cozens”, 1980, p. 9).","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Matthew Hargraves","2007-01"

His paintings and drawings (as well as the innovative oil paintings on glass that the artist was creating during this period) became more generalized than before; examples such as the present drawing sometimes come closer to suggesting rather than truly representing forms, and they are often set in an imaginary world of picturesque castles and winding roads. In some areas of this drawing the black and white chalk has been blended and softened with the artist's fingertips, or perhaps with a coil of felt or leather known as a stump. The only color in the composition is the blue paper support, which has faded to gray in the sky, making the mass of white clouds above the distant mountain stand out more brightly. This use of blue paper harkens back to the earliest days of Gainsborough's career, when he adopted this habit from his first teacher, the French draftsman Gravelot.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Cassandra Albinson","2007-01"
"12959","108","634276","2052","2","Donati’s Comet made its first and only documented appearance in 1858. Discovered on 2 June of that year by the astronomer Giovanni Battista Donati, by mid-August the comet was visible to the naked eye and remained so until December. An extraordinary spectacle by all accounts, the comet inspired numerous works of art, notably William Dyce's haunting meditation on time, “Pegwell Bay: A Recollection of 5th October 1858” (Tate, London). A close observer of natural phenomena, William Turner of Oxford often worked out of doors and inscribed his sketches with the date and time of their execution and remarks about the meteorological conditions. Turner exhibited this drawing at the Society of Painters in Water-Colours in 1859 with the title “Near Oxford—Half-past 7 o'clock, p.m., Oct. 5, 1858”; however, for all its apparent immediacy, the watercolor is not an accurate representation of the comet as it would have appeared on that night (Olson and Pasachoff, 1998, pp. 232-33). On 5 October the comet was at its most brilliant (the “Annual Register” reported that “the population of the western world was probably out of doors gazing on the phenomenon”), passing over the huge and very bright star Arcturus at 7:11 pm, with its twin secondary plasma tails visible, but neither the star nor its tails are depicted in Turner's watercolor.Although the specificity implied in its title may seem somewhat spurious, Turner’s image is nonetheless deeply compelling, contriving to suggest both ephemerality and timelessness and inspiring reflection on humankind's relationship to the natural world. Turner habitually used a combination of watercolor and gouache to give his works their striking density, but Jane Bayard has suggested that his technique of using numerous small touches to build up the sky of “Donati’s Comet” may have been influenced by J. F. Lewis’s monumental watercolor “Frank Encampment”, which was exhibited to acclaim three years earlier (Bayard, 1981, p. 70).","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Gillian Forrester","2007-01"
"13045","108","634278","9450","2","Located about eight miles southwest of Edinburgh, Roslin Castle was built in the fourteenth century; it was damaged to a great extent after being besieged in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Its ruins, on a cliff overlooking the North Esk River, were celebrated by poets and immortalized by artists. The “beautifully wild and awfully sublime” vista also attracted numerous visitors (White, 1977, no. 40). Despite its title, Sandby’s composition is more likely a reflection of his contemporaries’ longing for such views rather than an attempt to render the castle accurately. A new cultural practice seems to be unfolding here: the taste for picturesque touring, a broadened social experience inherited from the once-dominating and exclusive practice of the Italian Grand Tour.This cultural phenomenon is personified by the figures appearing on the right in Sandby’s work. A drawing entitled “Lady Frances Scott and Lady Elliott”—dated 1780—in the Paul Mellon Collection (YCBA) reveals the identity of two of these women. Lady Scott, an amateur artist of some repute (she was known to Horace Walpole), can be seen sketching a view with the help of a camera obscura. The design of this optical device was of disarming simplicity: after entering through a small opening in front of the box, light would hit a mirror placed at an angle, projecting the image onto a glass surface on which was laid a sheet, allowing its user to draw the outlines. Known since antiquity and used by many artists (Sandby included), the camera obscura was extremely popular with amateur artists and travelers anxious to keep visual journals of their quests for local color in the countryside.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Stephane Roy","2007-01"
"8892","108","634279","7112","2","When in Rome, Cozens bought himself an ass to enable him to tour the city's environs more easily. Lake Albano was a short ride from Rome and an essential stopping place for any traveler visiting Italy. Perched above this volcanic lake stands Castel Gandolfo, where Pope Urban VIII (1568–1644) built a small palace as an occasional retreat from Rome. To facilitate transport between the palace and the neighboring town of Albano, Urban began the Galleria di Sopra, a winding, tree-lined road that offered occasional views of Lake Albano, on one side, and of the Roman Campagna, on the other. In 1778 the 4th Earl of Bristol thought “a more romantic spot cannot be seen” and marveled at the “oldest and most venerable oaks, as well as chestnuts, that I ever saw” lining the road (Oppé, 1952, p. 135). Sketches Cozens made on the spot provided the basis of a number of drawings of the Galleria di Sopra, most being variants of what was essentially the same design. This unfinished drawing is, however, unique, both in focusing on the road itself, rather than the prospect of the Campagna, and in showing an approaching storm. Here a pair of goatherds hurries along the road to escape the oncoming tempest seen blowing in from the right, the trees already buffeted by advance winds. The emphasis on human vulnerability in the face of the forces of nature suggests a depth of meaning that puts this work beyond mere topography and reveals a debt to his father's theory of the intellectual potential of landscape painting. The lack of finish also displays Cozens’s innovative handling of watercolor: in some areas he uses gray underwashes, whereas in others he applies pure pigment in layers directly onto the white paper, giving the green leaves of the right-hand tree a jewel-like intensity of color.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Matthew Hargraves","2007-01"
"13073","108","634281","9450","2","This watercolor was made shortly before Skelton's trip to Italy, from which he was never to return. It belongs to a set of eight views of Canterbury and its vicinity, of which four are in the Paul Mellon Collection (ycba). Harbledown was the last village that pilgrims encountered before arriving at the ancient cathedral city of Canterbury, one and a half miles away. From atop the hill on which Harbledown is located (“Bobbe up-and-down” as the village was once referred to by Chaucer in his “Canterbury Tales”), pilgrims would have an unimpeded view of the cathedral. The road at the forefront of Skelton's composition is known today as the old Pilgrims Way, linking London to Canterbury. Hardly recognizable amid its densely wooded surroundings is the church of St. Nicholas, or “Harbledown hospital” (the subject is given by Skelton himself on the sheet's verso), still referred to nine hundred years later by locals as “The Leper Church,” or leper's hospital. This lazaret, with its adjoining almshouses (many of which have not survived), was a mandatory stop for early kings en route to Canterbury.“Harbledown” perfectly demonstrates Skelton's mastery in color variations. His inclination toward the observation of nature is suggested by an inscription on the old mount which reads: “Harbledown, A village near Canterbury./.J: Skelton 1757./.N: B: Drawn immediately after a heavy Summer-Shower.” His use of the method of “tinted drawing,” a technique that consisted of adding washes of colors over penciled outlines, is precise without being rigid; a full spectrum of greens and browns is exploited to effectively convey a damp atmosphere. As with other compositions in the Canterbury series, the artist represented Harbledown in a panoramic format in which the sense of depth is suggested by a wandering path.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Stephane Roy","2007-01"
"10761","108","634494","9449","2","After a decade of living and working in Cairo, John Frederick Lewis returned to London in 1851. He established himself as the preeminent interpreter of life in the East, painting genre scenes that played upon Western notions of Oriental luxury set amid bazaars, harems, desert landscapes, and mosques. He rendered each of these subjects in a style characterized by one contemporary critic as “marvelous in minute manipulation” (“Art Journal”, 1876, p. 176). Lewis's sharp style blurs boundaries in this meeting between East and West. A local term for anything European, the Frank of the Frank Encampment was Frederick William Robert Stewert, Viscount Castelreagh, author of “Diary of a Journey to Damascus” (1847). He left Cairo for Damascus in May 1842 and spent five days at Mount Sinai. Castelreagh commissioned a portrait of his party from Lewis, and although Lewis sketched some of the sitters before their departure (see Schoenherr, 2005, p. 107), it is unclear if “A Frank Encampment” was the picture commissioned in 1842 or if Lewis even observed the group at Mount Sinai. Castelreagh wears native dress and adopts a languid posture, recumbent amid a bevy of accoutrements-some “Eastern,” such as the hookah, some “Western,” such as tea, books, furniture, newspapers, and even a bottle of Harvey’s Sherry. In contrast, the local sheik Hussein of Gebel Tor (the Arabic name for Mount Sinai) stands erect, his serious, and perhaps dubious, expression directed towards the bloated lord whom he has agreed to guide across the desert. The monumental Monastery of St. Catherine in the distance serves as an appropriate backdrop for this encounter, a site of Christian pilgrimage and an active mosque. Emily Weeks observed in this work the “fragility of borders and the falseness of boundaries” that challenge the binary of East and West (Weeks, 2004, p. 240). Lewis exhibited the work at the Society of Painters in Water-Colours in 1856. When John Ruskin visited the exhibition, he singled out this work for his highest praise, “I have no hesitation in ranking it among the most wonderful pictures in the world” (Ruskin, “Works”, vol. 14, p. 74).","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Morna O'Neill","2007-01"

The expression “invent it” (from the Latin “invenit”, i.e., “has invented”) specifically refers to the convention of prints as well. Judging from the vignette-like design of this drawing, similar in format and inspiration to an equestrian subject in the Blofeld collection (background lacking), this piece may have been destined to be part of a sourcebook or design manual for artists. The overly emphatic signature, with its exaggerated festooning, is perhaps indicative of a work produced in Barlow's early career. Indeed, comparison with “David Slaying the Lion” (British Museum, London) suggests that the drawing dates to the late 1640s.The exact subject of this composition is uncertain; the title was not given by the artist himself.

This work epitomizes a shift occurring in the social practice of hunting. Whereas Francis Barlow depicts hunting mostly as a physical and strenuous activity, Wyck shows it as a fashionable pastime. In fact, the present scene may have less to do with “hunting” than with “sporting,” associated with recreation and amusement. Sporting embodied politeness and refinement. It was believed that nobility could be attained through horsemanship, closely associated with the ancient glory of chivalry. Given that sporting required vast open spaces, the representation of landscape in works of art quickly became a pretext to show prosperity. Sporting scenes such as this one were also seen as a celebration of country life; for opulent residents of large seventeenth- and eighteenth-century metropolises, being able to live outside the city was perceived as beneficial to health and as a sign of wealth.This composition is a fine example of Wyck’s ability to merge the genres of landscape and hunting scenes. Unlike most sporting painters, as an author once judiciously observed, Wyck “contrived really to make pictures for the connoisseur without disappointing the sportsman” (Grant, 1957, p. 46).","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Stephane Roy","2007-01"

More likely models for Smith’s evocative nocturne are the paintings (and the prints after the paintings) of moonlight coastal scenes by the French landscape and marine painter Claude Joseph Vernet, which were often part of a set of landscapes or seascapes illustrating the times of day.

Built between 1739 and 1750 (with construction delayed by the collapse of a pier in 1747), the bridge was in a much more advanced state of completion at the time Canaletto was in London than he indicates in this drawing. This inaccuracy hardly seems to matter, however. Throughout his career Canaletto had evinced an interest in portraying buildings and scenery at moments of change or accretion. Here, the uncompleted Westminster Bridge functions analogously to the fanciful ruins in his earlier Venetian works. The picturesque qualities of the foreground structures were clearly of equal interest to him. The massive wooden water tower, crowned with a finial, distributed water to outlying areas of London. York Watergate (the marble structure at the foot of the tower), fashioned to resemble a baroque temple, was the riverside entrance to the gardens of the demolished York House. In these forms, Canaletto found buildings that echoed the campaniles and canal-side churches of his native Venice.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Cassandra Albinson","2007-01"

To the left, a solitary goatherd drives his flock home along the Galleria before darkness falls.

When Thomas Jones visited in 1776 and walked from Castel Gandolfo to Lake Nemi nearby, he admired the landscape in eulogistic terms: “This walk considered with respect to its classick locality, the Awful marks of the most tremendous Convulsions of nature in the remotest Ages, the antient and modern Specimens of Art, and the various extensive &amp; delightful prospects it commands is, to the Scholar, naturalist, Antiquarian and Artist, without doubt, the most pleasing and interesting in the Whole World” (Jones, “Memoirs”, p. 55).That this region held such an array of cultural associations explains the exceptional popularity of the design; there are at least eleven surviving versions of this watercolor from Cozens’s hand, each one slightly different in atmosphere and mood. In this example the mood is pastoral and the inclusion of the goatherd evokes the landscapes of Claude or the poetry of Virgil’s Eclogues. At the same time his archaic presence hints at what Protestant Englanders saw as the unenlightened and backward state of modern papal Rome. Surveying the decayed and uncultivated state of the Roman suburbs, compared to supposed English prosperity, William Beckford concluded they proved “how completely the papal government contrives to make its subjects miserable” (Beckford, “Dreams”, p. 190).","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Matthew Hargraves","2007-01"
"14270","108","634506","1252","2","The years that Palmer spent in Shoreham were the happiest and most creative of his life. Palmer had first visited the village in Kent, southeast of London, in 1824, and stayed there with the Ancients periodically over the next few years. In 1828, his father, retired from bookselling, rented a house in Shoreham, and Palmer moved in with him. Money left him by his grandfather allowed Palmer to pursue his art without concern for making a living.Throughout his years in Shoreham, Palmer produced monochrome drawings in black and brown ink and watercolor that he referred to as his “blacks.” Indebted to Blake’s wood engraved “Illustrations to Robert Thornton’s Pastorals of Virgil” (1821) for their simple forms of landscape, figures, and animals and for their crepuscular atmosphere, these drawings frequently depicted moonlit scenes that perhaps reflect the nocturnal wanderings of the Ancients in the countryside around Shoreham.“A Moonlight Scene with a Winding River” is one of the more densely worked up of these “blacks” with a heavy admixture of opaque white paint. The landscape seems to pulsate with life. On the left is a cottage or mill; on the right, a sheepfold. The palm tree on the right adds an exotic element perhaps deriving from a print by Dürer or Schongauer; it has been suggested that it may be a symbol of the Christian’s victory over death (Lister, 1988, no. 73) or a punning reference on the artist’s name (White, 1977, p. 120).","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Scott Wilcox","2007-01"
"14275","108","634507","9450","2","Located in Whittlebury Forest, Wakefield Lodge was an imposing hunting lodge designed by William Kent for the 2nd Duke of Grafton. Its completion was overseen by the 3rd Duke of Grafton (short-lived prime minister from 14 October 1768 to 28 January 1770), who continuously increased the size of the estate.Having been trained as a topographer, Sandby felt particularly at ease with estate portraiture. He chose to depict Wakefield lodge from a distance rather than at close range, thereby displaying the property in its wider setting. As is often the case in Sandby’s oeuvre, the artist peppered his composition with references to estate life. The grazing horses remind the viewer that the majestic 250-acre park was host to the Wakefield Lawn Races, while the wary herd of stags is evocative of the Grafton Hunt. Sandby’s artistic aspirations never prevented him from adding a touch of lightness: one cannot help noticing a raggedy couple surreptitiously bundling wood and hiding behind a tree as a phaeton approaches, making this an exquisite scene of rustic burlesque.Although not as frequently depicted by Sandby as Windsor views, Wakefield Lodge was the subject of some repetitions as well. The present work was one of two Wakefields exhibited at the Society of Artists in 1767. Sandby also produced two watercolors from different viewpoints that were later engraved by M.A. Rooker for “A Collection of Landscapes”, published in London in 1777. Other versions of the lodge were made the next year for the “Copperplate Magazine”, to which Sandby contributed many designs. These endeavors are telling of the artist's condition: by hanging his work on the walls of the Society of Artists, Sandby most likely hoped to attract private and wealthy patrons wishing to have their own estates depicted in a similar fashion; by providing designs to publishers, he could make a decent living while courting a larger public.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Stephane Roy","2007-01"

The jumble of London houses is punctuated by the square tower of St. Olave’s Church, on the left, and a similar, smaller tower to the right, identified as St. George’s, Southwark. The bend in the Thames toward Greenwich is filled with boats, while the Tower of London is roughly sketched in pencil on the opposite bank.This study was for sheets 6 and 7, the right-hand sections of the “Long View”. The Center’s collection also includes the study for sheets 2 and 3, “A View from St. Mary's, Southwark, Looking Towards Westminster”. Hollar apparently made these sketches before fleeing England for Antwerp in 1644 and used them as the basis for the engraving he produced there. A. M. Hind speculated that the present study was done from the tower of St. Mary Overie (now Southwark Cathedral), the location named in the title of the study for sheets 2 and 3. Working from this sketch, Hollar depicts a markedly different perspective in the final engraving, in which the view-point swings sharply to the left, looking more directly toward the Tower of London and eliminating the view toward Eltham and the top of the Thames bend. The construction of St. Olave’s Church tower also changes in the engraving, to a centered cupola and two sets of windows.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Lisa Ford","2007-01"
"8691","108","634513","1252","2","Watercolors from Cotman’s stay in Yorkshire and County Durham in the summer of 1805 have been widely considered not only the high point of his work as a watercolorist but also some of the most strikingly original watercolors of the British School. Indeed, Laurence Binyon described them as “the most perfect examples of pure watercolour ever painted in Europe” (Binyon, 1931, p. 132). Cotman first visited Yorkshire in the summer of 1803, traveling north with an introduction to the Cholmeley family at Brandsby Hall, near York. Cotman became a great favorite of the Cholmeleys and returned to Brandsby the following two summers. After his visit there in July 1805, he proceeded to Rokeby Park, the home of John Morritt, an antiquarian and book collector, whose wife received drawing lessons from Cotman. He spent six weeks sketching in the area.Although the publication in 1813 of Sir Walter Scott’s poem about the English Civil War, titled Rokeby, drew international attention to the area between the rivers Tees and Greta, at the time of Cotman’s visit, it was not yet an object of picturesque tourism. In a letter to Dawson Turner of 30 November 1805, Cotman wrote that his “chief study has been colouring from Nature, many of which [studies] are close copies of that fickle Dame, consequently valuable on that account” (Hill, 2005, p. 145). Whether “In Rokeby Park” is one of these studies painted from nature has been the subject of much debate. David Hill, in his recent detailed study of Cotman’s work in the north, suggests that it most likely is (Hill, 2005, pp. 125–26). Perhaps because they were lacking in conventionally picturesque qualities, “In Rokeby Park” and its companion drawings from the visit to Rokeby did not find immediate purchasers. The watercolor remained in the artist’s possession for years, until it was acquired by Francis Gibson, a banker, who became Cotman’s patron in his later years.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Scott Wilcox","2007-01"

In all but a few minor details, the Yale version replicates the earlier watercolor exactly. Another version of the composition in oils on paper by Thomas Jones is in the collection of the Yale Center for British Art.

"11145","108","634519","9449","2","Throughout his career, Thomas Malton specialized in topographical views and perspective drawings such as this view of St. Paul’s Cathedral. The prominent role of architects in the establishment of the Royal Academy in 1768 brought new attention to architectural drawing and the vital role of the draftsman in translating plans and elevations into perspectival renderings. Trained at the Royal Academy, Malton was highly skilled in the mathematical complexities and optical accommodations required for perspective drawings, providing some illustrations for his father’s treatise on perspective. He hoped to be elected an associate of the Royal Academy as an architect. He never executed a building and, having the misfortune to stand for election at the same time as John Soane, was rejected by the Academy. In a bid to establish his credentials as an artist and gain acceptance to the Academy as a painter, Malton turned his eye to the city around him, publishing the aquatint series “A Picturesque Tour Through the Cities of London and Westminster”, exhibiting watercolors in tandem with this project. This view of St. Paul’s was one of a suite of views of the cathedral exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1797; the aquatint version followed in 1798. Malton admired Wren’s design, devoting eight plates to St. Paul’s and commenting: “The dome is a stupendous work, that cannot be viewed without surprize and delight, as the happiest and boldest production of architecture in England” (Malton, 1792, p. 68). He also probably appreciated the challenges presented to his skills by Wren’s design. To convey the vast grandeur of the structure, which acts as classical basilica, tourist attraction, and society promenade, he deployed the convention known as “scena per angolo” to construct perspective along one or more diagonals rather than along a central axis.

It illustrates an episode from the Book of Judges in which the wicked king Abimelech, having killed his seventy brothers and the entire population of Sechem, besieges the city of Thebez. Receiving his mortal wound at the hand of a woman who throws a piece of millstone from the ramparts, Abimelech commands his armor bearer to dispatch him.Dadd’s painting shows Abimelech receiving the coup de grâce on a chaotic field of battle. Although some elements are certainly the products of Dadd’s inventive powers, such as the ruffs worn around the shins of some of the soldiers, others may have been informed by the sketches he made while traveling in the Middle East. The frieze-like arrangement of figures in a shallow compositional space is typical of Dadd’s work. It has been argued that the disposition of arms, legs, and spears owes something to Jacques-Louis David’s “Oath of the Horatii”, which Dadd knew and on which he drew in other paintings, such as “The Flight Out of Egypt”, painted in 1849–50 (Tate, London).

"9574","108","634553","7020","2","Despite his reputation as an artist who took his principal inspiration from the ancient world, Flaxman argued in his lectures to the Royal Academy that “there are more suitable artistic subjects to be found in the Old and New Testaments than in pagan mythology” (Bindman, 1979, p. 31). “The Creation of the Heavens” is an example of Flaxman’s lesser-known series of biblical drawings. In this dramatic composition the aggregate mass of God and his angels flies upward, cutting a diagonal swath across the darkened paper. Sidestepping the problem of representing the Creator’s visage, Flaxman depicts God and the angels from behind, their forms simplified into a few strokes of watercolor. Stars or planets are suggested by the spots of untouched white paper surrounded by the dark watercolor wash in the background.Locating this undated drawing within Flaxman’s career is difficult. During his sojourn in Rome we know that he spent time drawing illustrations for “Pilgrim's Progress” and also biblical subject matter such as “Enoch Raised to Heaven” (1792, British Museum, London). Influenced by the Renaissance art in the Italian capital, Flaxman is clearly indebted in this drawing to Michelangelo’s “Creation of the Sun, Moon, and Planets” in the Sistine Chapel. Scholars have also noted, however, the similarity between “The Creation of the Heavens” and plates from William Blake’s “The First Book of Urizen” (1794). It might therefore make sense to date the drawing to after Flaxman’s return to London in 1794, the same year that Urizen appeared.

"10753","108","634556","1252","2","Like the oil sketches on which his modern reputation largely rests, Jones’s watercolors were meant not for sale or public display but for his personal amusement and reference. In his memoirs Jones recorded “making some Drawings in the garden belonging to the English colledge upon Mount Palatine” on 21 May 1778 (Jones, “Memoirs”, p. 72). This watercolor, together with another of a similar view in a private collection (Sumner and Smith, 2003, no. 89), were presumably the drawings made that day. At least Jones would have done the graphite underdrawing on the Palatine. The actual working up of his drawings in watercolor, quite highly finished for sketches done outdoors, may have taken place later. Despite the popular modern conception of Jones as a plein-air artist, derived from his oil sketches, it seems likely that the drawings were not finished on the spot. As Greg Smith has suggested, Jones’s standard practice was probably to draw on site with graphite and add watercolor later (Sumner and Smith, 2003, pp. 185–99). Although the watercolors may lack the plein-air immediacy of the oil sketches—and we may question whether some of the oil sketches may also be less spontaneous creations than they appear—they, nonetheless, have an undeniable sensitivity and delicate beauty.

As the leading proponent of the revival of the Palladian style in England and an architect himself, Boyle was influential in establishing this classical style as the predominant architectural language of the mid-eighteenth century. The Italian architect's I quattri libri dell'architettura was the first translated into English in 1715, the same year as the appearance of the first volume of Colen Campbell's homage to Palladio, Vitruvius Britannicus. Kent's interior decoration, architecture, and garden design repeatedly return to the classicism and rationalism of Palladio for inspiration.General James Tyrell continued his father's plans to renovate the house and gardens of Shotover Park when he inherited the property in 1718, and Kent's design indicates Tyrell's desire for the latest style, to transform his grounds into a landscape inspired by the paintings of Claude. Kent's temple, erected near the west front of the house, displays the even proportions, solid masses, and plain exterior characteristic of his interpretation of the Palladian style. The drawing depicts the traditional plan, elevation, and cross-section of the structure. However, Kent has also included an ornate grotesque design that does not correspond to his depiction of the decorated ceiling of the temple interior.

In this drawing he presents the house in plan and elevation, two traditional methods of non-perspectival projection used to convey a stricture in the eighteenth century. This practice isolates the structure from its surroundings, making it unclear whether this house was intended for the town or the country.

A pupil of Sir William Chambers (cats. 116-17) from 1764 Yenn was later employed as a clerk in Chambers office, eventually becoming chief architectural draftsman. Scholars have characterized Yenn as a ""faithful disciple of Chambers,"" and indeed Chambers himself described his pupil as ""an ingenious faithful intelligent servant' as late as 1774. While his designs indicate the influence of Chambers's neoclassical style, Yenn's work is distinguished by its delicate line and color. Color became an important aspect of late eighteenth-century architectural drawing, as the influence of French neoclassical architects who favored the practice coincided with the development of watercolor cakes, which made the medium accessible to those who did not know how to mix their own pigments. The use of color in the architectural interior received great attention in this period, when architects designed no only the exterior but also the interior décor, the furniture, and even the doorknobs. Yenn's use of light pinks and greens indicates his knowledge of color theory, as it echoes exactly the definition of ""beautiful color"" supplied by Edmund Burke in his Philosophical Inquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and the Beautiful of 1757: ""the colours of beautiful bodies must not be dusky or muddy, bur clean and fair…those which see, most appropriate to beauty are the milder of every sort: light greens, soft blues, weak whites, pink reds and violets.""","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Morna O'Neill","2001-05"

Taylor at one point contemplated razing the structure, described by later commentators as ""a long range of tasteless buildings,"" and rebuilding it along more fashionable lines to plans devised by Sir William Chambers in 1765 (also in the Center's collection). While Chambers's redesigned exterior was never executed, his rival Robert Adam was commissioned to decorate the interior in 1771, completing designs for the Hall, Staircase, Eating Parlor, Saloon, and Lady's room, including furniture and structural fittings. The Scottish-born Adam reputedly boasted the he ""brought about in this country a revolution in the whole system of this useful and elegant art.""

The wood and Stucco decorations appropriate classical motifs such as the Three Graces, while the central painting of picturesque figures lounging beside the Pyramid of Gaius Cestius in Rome recalls fashionable eighteenth-century capricci. The design for the staircase, never executed as shown, displays Dam's talent for adapting his decorative style to different spaces. Adam's revolution was one of both form a practice. He received instruction in Rome from the master French Academic architect and draftsman Charles-Louis Clérisseau, and the practice he established in London around 1760 in partnership with his brother James is an early example of modern architecture and design firms. Serendipitously, Adam's rise to prominence accompanied an increase in country-house building in Great Britain perhaps fueled by new-found commercial wealth.

Taylor at one point contemplated razing the structure, described by later commentators as ""a long range of tasteless buildings,"" and rebuilding it along more fashionable lines to plans devised by Sir William Chambers in 1765 (also in the Center's collection). While Chambers's redesigned exterior was never executed, his rival Robert Adam was commissioned to decorate the interior in 1771, completing designs for the Hall, Staircase, Eating Parlor, Saloon, and Lady's room, including furniture and structural fittings. The Scottish-born Adam reputedly boasted the he ""brought about in this country a revolution in the whole system of this useful and elegant art."" After a Grand Tour of Italy and extended study of both actual Rome ruins and their interpretation by Giovanni Battista neoclassical style to London. Informed by an intense study of ancient roman and Renaissance architecture, he demonstrated his skill at combining the two, as in his decorative scheme for the Eating Parlor at Headfort House. The wood and Stucco decorations appropriate classical motifs such as the Three Graces, while the central painting of picturesque figures lounging beside the Pyramid of Gaius Cestius in Rome recalls fashionable eighteenth-century capricci. The design for the staircase, never executed as shown, displays Dam's talent for adapting his decorative style to different spaces. Adam's revolution was one of both form a practice. He received instruction in Rome from the master French Academic architect and draftsman Charles-Louis Clérisseau, and the practice he established in London around 1760 in partnership with his brother James is an early example of modern architecture and design firms.

Writing shortly after Gravelot's return to Paris, George Vertue noted that the Frenchman had gained the ""reputation"" of a most ingenious draughtsman during the time he has been in London.""

One of the targets of King's satirical poems was Frances Brudenell, Countess of Newburgh, the subject of the adoring poem Myra by Goerge Granville, Baron Landsdowne. In Gravelot's illustration Granville shows off a portrait of a beautiful Myra to Apollo, while a satyr delights in the discrepancy between the painted image and the actual appearance of the sitter, to whom he points.

Thornhill's work progressed from informal studies to large cartoons and finally wall painting itself in grisaille. Working studies such as this one allowed the artists to arrange compositional groupings and experiment with the placement and expression of figures, as his attention to the fallen St. Paul demonstrates.

The terra-cotta sculpture on which Roubiliac thoughtfully leans bears some resemblance to the head of the Britannia figure in the sculptor's 1753 monument to Admiral Sir Peter Warren in Westminster Abbey; it was also described as the head of Medusa by a nineteenth-century reviewer - an appropriate emblem for a portrait of a sculptor, whose occupation is to transform living features into stone. The portrait has been attributed recently to François-Xavier Vispré, a fellow-Huguenot and close friend and neighbor of Roubiliac. Although stylistic comparison with known works by Vispré has not been conclusive, circumstantial detail makes the attribution seem very likely. Vispré exhibited a pastel of Roubiliac at the Society of Artists in London in 1760, and this may have been ca. 6. The exhibited portrait made a powerful impression on the reviewer of the Imperial Magazine, or Complete Monthly Intelligencer, whose enthralled account suggests at least affinities with the Center's drawing: 'the man himself alive, breathing and just going to speak; most admirable! and himself never in marble cut better.""

One of the most important of his British patrons was the antiquary Richard Colt Hoare, who wrote in 1787 that four drawings that Ducros had done for him ""will be the admiration of the whole town &amp; put all our English artists, even the great Mr. Smith [John 'Warwick' Smith] to the blush.""In 1822 Colt Hoare, who eventually owned thirteen watercolors by Ducros, credited the artist with a key role in the development of watercolor painting in Britain. The advancement from drawing to painting in water-colours did not take place til after the introduction of Louis du Cros, a Swiss artist who settled at Rome. His works proved the force as well as the consequence that could be given to the unsubstantial body of water-colours, and to him I attribute the first knowledge and power if watercolours. Hence have sprung a numerous succession of Artists in this line.Colt Hoare's partiality toward Ducros led him to overestimate the Swiss artists influence on British watercolorists; there is no evidence that the achievements in watercolor by ""Warwick"" Smith (cat. 74), John Robert Cozens (cats. 103-4 and 142), and other British artists working in Italy were based on a knowledge of Ducros' work. Colt Hoare was, however, an important early patron of J.M.W.

James Northcote (1746-1831) was of the opinion that ""Westall is as much entitled to share in the honor of the school of painting in water-colours, as his highly gifted contemporaries Girtin and Turner."" In a series of articles titled ""Observations of the Rise and Progress of Painting in Watercolours,"" which appeared in Ackermann's repository of Arts in 1812 and 1813, the unnamed author (probably William Henry Pyne) concluded that ""the entire development of that powerful union of richness and effect which at length elevated this art to vie with the force of painting in oil, was left for the genius of Richard Westall to complete.""In his exhibition of watercolors, generally scenes from literature or classical mythology or rustic genre subjects, Westall combined elements of neoclassicism with rococo decorativeness.

He remained in England (with two trips back to Italy in 1750-1 and 1753) until 1755, painting and drawing views mostly of London. The crisp assurance and liveliness of Canaletto's style gave an infusion of energy to topographical art in Britain. His bold yet elegant pen line, evident in this elaborate drawing of the Thames, had a particularly potent legacy. Even though the emphasis moved away from pen outline as the century progressed, the influence of Canaletto's line can still be seen at the end of the century in the drawing style of Thomas Girtin and even well into the nineteenth century in the work of Samuel Prout. The impact of Canaletto's English work on the marine painter and specialist in views of the Thomas Samuel Scott, is frequently cited, yet this drawing, with the subsequent oil paintings that Canaletto made of the same composition, appears to be an instance of Canaletto copying Scott. When Canaletto arrived in London in May 1746, Westminster Bridge was almost finished, with all the arches completed, but Canaletto shows only five arches in place/ The drawing seems therefore, to be based not on the actual view up the Thames that Canaletto would have seen but on a painting of the view done by Scott in either 1742 or 1743 (Simon Dickinson Ltd.).

"9639","108","703209","1252","2","Thomas Gainsborough is perhaps the most naturally gifted and fluent of all British draftsmen. He seldom produced drawings as finished, saleable works; and, though he did make drawings in preparation for paintings, mostly he drew just for the pleasure it gave him. That pleasure informs the character and quality of his draftsmanship. It was in the act of drawing and in the creation of landscape compositions that he found an escape from the onerous business of painting portraits.In Gainsborough's landscapes an early naturalism rooted in the example of seventeenth-century Dutch landscape painting is succeeded by, but not wholly gives way to, a more abstract language of landscape forms, which not only recalls aspects of Claude's and Dughet's landscapes but echoes the composite method of Alexander Cozen (cat. 45) [B1975.4.1480]. Both A Hilly Landscape with Figures Approaching a Bridge [B1998.14.1] and A Woodland Pool with Rocks and Plants [B1975.4.1198] date from Gainsborough's period residence in Bath (1759-74). A Hilly Landscape with its flickering light effects and variety of touch embodies the developing Picturesque aesthetic. It also marks a movement away from the Dutch-inspired naturalism of his years in Suffolk to a more synthetic approach, in which his landscapes are constructed from a repertoire of recurring formal elements.A Woodland Pool With Rocks and Plants demonstrates that Gainsborough had not wholly abandoned natural observation for the play of his fancy. Yet just how natural is this drawing? The Gainsborough scholar John Hayes has characterized the work as ""a study from nature,"" yet we know from Gainsborough's friend Uvedale Price that he assembled in the studio ""roots, stones and mosses, from which he formed, and then studied, foregrounds in miniature.""In the hands of theorists such as Price, the idea of the Picturesque was expanded from Gilpin's conception, based on the paintings of Claude, to include rustic and low life genre scenes. Gainsborough's own taste for idyllic scenes of rustic peasant life played a key role in Price's thinking. Wooded Landscape with Figures [B1977.14.4697], a drawing from the end of Gainsborough's life, together with the painting which he developed from it, Peasant Smoking at a Cottage Door (University of California at Los Angeles), represent the culmination and the most monumental statement of this line of imagery in Gainsborough's work.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Scott Wilcox","2001-05"

By choosing a vantage point in which the domes of Christopher Wren's Royal Naval Hospital are visible, but the Royal Observatory and the Queen's House are not, John Robert Cozens created a composition which downplays topographical particularity in favor of an evocative association of the view with that of Rome and, in his coloring and atmosphere, imbues the view with the same melancholy grandeur that characterizes his Roman scenes.

The son of the portrait painter and pastellist William Hoare (1702-92), and nephew of his namesake, the sculptor Prince Hoare the Elder (c. 1711-69), the younger Prince Hoare is best known for the neoclassical figure drawings he produced during his association with the Fuseli circle in the 1770s. Hoare showed an aptitude for drawing from an early age and entered the royal Academy Schools in 1773. He traveled to Italy in 1776, visiting first Florence and the settling in Rome, where he was to spend the next three years. On his return to England in 1780, Hoare exhibited portraits and history paintings at the royal Academy, be he abandoned painting in 1785, avowedly for reasons of ""delicacy of health."" Hoare confided in his friend Joseph Farington that ""he aquitted the profession because he could not succeed in that practice as he wished,"" but his surviving works nonetheless indicate the Hoare was an accomplished draftsman and portrait painter. The subject has never been identified, nor has the drawing been securely dated. The cap worn by the young woman indicates a date of the late 1770s, and Hoare may have made the drawing in Italy. During his stay in Rome, Hoare fell in love with the talented and attractive painter Maria Hadfiled, who later married Richard Cosway (see cats. 19-20 and 40). The features of the sitter resemble Maria's, and it is tempting to speculate that this study commemorates this romantic episode.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Gillian Forrester","2001-05"
"8273","108","703212","1252","2","The elegance apparent in Richard Cosway's portrait drawings and miniatures (cats. 19-20) pervaded every aspect of his art and life. While many eighteenth-century artists assembled useful working collections of prints, drawings, and paintings by their contemporaries and earlier masters, Cosway was a virtuoso collector. His acquisition of paintings, drawings, and prints along with furniture and objects d'art, was part and parcel of his fashionable and extravagant lifestyle. But if Cosway's collecting could be flamboyant and at times eccentric, he was also a serious connoisseur, and anartist sensitive to the lessons he could glean from the old masters. After seeing Cosway's collections of drawings in 1811, Thomas Lawrence had to revise his opinion of Cosway as an artist, impressed as he was by ""the knowledge - the familiar acquaintance with , study; and often happy appropriation and even liberal imitation of the Old Masters, the fix'd landmark of Art, of this little Being which we have been accustom'd never to think of speak of but with contempt."" Lawrence, himself a serious collector of drawings, bought a number of sheets from the auction of Cosway's prints and drawings in 1822. As Lawrence comment suggests, Cosway's collection of Old Master drawings informed his own drawings of subjects taken from the time-honored themes of classical literature and the Bible. In these drawings the grace and finesse of Cosway's draftsmanship is allied to as sensuousness that in subjects such as Venus and Mars becomes elegant eroticism.

He studied with Brown at the Royal Academy shortly before Brown's death in 1787, at which time he acquired the contents of the artists studio, including 219 drawings that formed the basis for Ottley's distinguished collection of Old Master Drawings. During an extended period of study in Italy from 1791 to 1799, he added groups of drawings by Parmigianino, Raphael, and Michelangelo to his collection.This drawing of a scene from the first act of Shakespeare's The Tempest, with its figure of Prospero clearly recalling Michelangelo's figure of Christ in the Sistine Chapel Last Judgment, probably dates from shortly after Ottley's return to London. It is almost certainly one of the group of drawings illustrating The Tempest included in the sale of Ottley's works in 1838. Other Tempest drawings by Ottley are in the British Museum and the Stanford University Museum of Art. That most of these drawings have traditionally been attributed to either John Brown (as is the case with Prospero Summoning Ariel) or John Flaxman is indicative of Both Ottley's stylistic indebtedness to his mentor and his friend but also of the assured quality of his draftsmanship.

Although his designs, such as this one for the Parliament House in Dublin, echo the forms of ancient Roman architecture, Gandon himself never traveled beyond Great Britain and Ireland. Rather, he learned classical architecture through discussions with Chambers, by looking at prints and drawings, and by studying books such as Vitruvius Britannicus. Admired during his lifetime as ""Vitruvius Hibernicus,"" Gandon published s two-volume expansion of Campbell's seminal text. Through Irish connections made at the London home of Paul Sandby, Gandon was invited to Ireland by John Dawson, 2nd Viscount Carlow (later 1st Earl of Portarlington). In Dublin by 1781, he became a prominent figure in the redesign of Dublin that marked this period. His designs for the domed Custom House (1781-91) on the River Liffey and the adjacent Four Courts building established the public face of Georgian Dublin. He also designed additions to the Irish Parliament House when Westminster renounced its right to legislate Ireland in 1783. In this design for the Ionic-columned west front, Gandon demonstrates his study of classical form as well as his interest in sculptural decoration. The project of expanding both the House of Lords and the House of Commons became the work of many architects, and Irish architect Samuel Hayes adapted Gandon's design for the west Façade.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Morna O'Neill","2001-05"

Indeed, Flaxman's spare, and unrelentingly linear drawings are the quintessential statements of neoclassical draftsmanship. They take the process of neoclassical simplification of forms, seen in its early stages in Gavin Hamilton's illustrations to the Iliad (cats. 31-2) [B1975.4.884 and B1975.4.885], to a new level of severity and abstraction. Both of these drawings [B1977.14.6168 and B1981.25.2586] demonstrate the exchange of visual ideas between Flaxman and his friend William Blake (see cats. 36-7) [B1992.8.11(9) and B1992.8.11(23)] as well as their creative responses to earlier art. In Get Thee Behind Me, Satan the commanding figure of Christ is taken from Raphael's cartoon Christ's Charge to St. Peter. Blake made use of the same figure in his Christ appearing the Apostles after the Resurrection, one of his large color prints of the mid-1790s. Flaxman's fleeing Satan appears, rotated one hundred and eighty degrees, as the evil angel in The Good and Evil Angels Struggling for Possession of a Child, another of Blake's large color prints. And the floating angels to the right of Christ in Flaxman's drawing, which also have their counterparts in Blake's art of the period, testify to a shared interest in the linear expressiveness of Gothic art. The Creation of the Heavens may have been inspired by Micelangelo's Sistine-ceiling image of God creating the heavens; but, in its expression of cosmic energy through a radical simplification of the human form, it is even more Blakean.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Scott Wilcox","2001-05"

By 1757 he was practicing successfully as a portraitist in crayons, producing attractive pastels in a hallmark oval format. According to his friend Thomas Mulvany, Hamilton's drawings were ""laid in with very few colours, the prevailing tone of which was grey, and then finished with red and black chalk. They were marked with great skill and truth, the features, particularly, the eyes, were expressed with great feeling; but…they had all the appearance of having been hurried rather than neglected."" As Mulvany observed, Hamilton's early pastels often seemed unfinished and indicate that the artist was already working under great pressures to fulfill the demands of his large clientele. In 1764 Hamilton moved to London, where he enlarged his repertoire to include large full-length pastel portraits rivaling those of Daniel Gardner (see cat. 9) His portrait practice was so successful that ""he could scarcely execute all the orders that came in upon him,"" but like many of his contemporaries, Hamilton resented the drudgery of portraiture, and in 1779 he went to Rome to pursue his cherished ambition of becoming a history painter. He remained there for thirteen years, but economic necessity forced him to return reluctantly to Dublin (exile for one who truly loves art,"" Hamilton observed bitterly) and resumed his portrait practice.

After the restoration Charles II extended the park by thirty-six acres, stocked it with deer, planted fruit trees, and built The Mall, the tree lined avenue which still exists today. The rapid expansion of London in the eighteenth century was accompanied by a concern to retain or even introduce, if necessary, rural elements into the city, and the therapeutic and social value of the parks was widely acknowledged. In 1774 Oliver Goldsmith commented, ""if a man be splenetic [i.e., afflicted with melancholia or hypochrondria], he may every day meet companions in the seats of St. James's Park, with whose groans he may mix his own and pathetically talk of the weather."" Londoner's enthusiasm for their parks was reflected in the popularity of picturesque sub-urban pastoral like Julius Ceasar Ibbetson's watercolor of St. James Park. Ibbetson, who lived in London from 1777on 1798, produced a large group of drawings and paintings depicting metropolitan park scenes, often paring summer and winter subjects.

With the prominent role of architects in these proceedings and the inclusion of architecture as one of the branches of the Academy, architectural drawings were given increased attention, and they were frequently shown in proximity to paintings at the annual Academy exhibitions. As a result, a new kind of artist arose: the architectural draftsman whose role was to translate the plan, section, and elevation designs of the architect into an actual albeit imagined, structure as well as to record existing monuments. Thomas Malton the Younger, like his father the perspective specialist Thomas Malton the Elder (1726-1801), was one such artist. Trained as an architect in the Royal Academy schools, Malton specialized in topographical views and perspective drawings. Although he showed his own designs at Academy Exhibitions, he never executed a building. He is best remembered for his successful use of the newly invented method of aquatint in his A Picturesque Tour through the Cities of London and Westminster. In this drawing, he employs the Italian convention known as scena per Angola, a technique used in theater design to construct perspective along one or more diagonals rather than a central axis. This innovation allows Malton to convey the vast Grandeur of Wren's St. Paul's, which acts as both classical basilica and society promenade. This drawing is one of a suite of views of St. Paul's exhibited by Malton at the Royal Academy in 1792.

This technique, which he used for cat. 9, presumably was intended to replicate the textures and density of oil painting, while retaining the brilliancy of color associated with pastel. Gardner's brief period as an assistant in Joshua Reynolds studio clearly had a lasting influence; demonstrating Reynold's conception of historical portraiture, Gardner's work uses poses and compositional patterns derived from antique sources and the works of Old Masters. The portrait of Mrs. Justinian Casamajor with eight of her children is a fine example of Gardner's small-scale Grand Manner portraiture. In this ambitious drawing the mother is depicted as an allegorical figure of Charity, presumably in allusion to her astonishing fecundity (the Casamajors, a landed Hertfordshire family, reportedly had no fewer than twenty-two children); the group of children with a ram on the left is suggestive of a bacchanalian procession, rather than incongruously, and probably derives from a Renaissance or antique model.

"10095","108","703275","1252","2","Thomas Gainsborough is perhaps the most naturally gifted and fluent of all British draftsmen. He seldom produced drawings as finished, saleable works; and, though he did make drawings in preparation for paintings, mostly he drew just for the pleasure it gave him. That pleasure informs the character and quality of his draftsmanship. It was in the act of drawing and in the creation of landscape compositions that he found an escape from the onerous business of painting portraits.In Gainsborough's landscapes an early naturalism rooted in the example of seventeenth-century Dutch landscape painting is succeeded by, but not wholly gives way to, a more abstract language of landscape forms, which not only recalls aspects of Claude's and Dughet's landscapes but echoes the composite method of Alexander Cozen (cat. 45) [B1975.4.1480]. Both A Hilly Landscape with Figures Approaching a Bridge [B1998.14.1] and A Woodland Pool with Rocks and Plants [B1975.4.1198] date from Gainsborough's period residence in Bath (1759-74). A Hilly Landscape with its flickering light effects and variety of touch embodies the developing Picturesque aesthetic. It also marks a movement away from the Dutch-inspired naturalism of his years in Suffolk to a more synthetic approach, in which his landscapes are constructed from a repertoire of recurring formal elements.A Woodland Pool With Rocks and Plants demonstrates that Gainsborough had not wholly abandoned natural observation for the play of his fancy. Yet just how natural is this drawing? The Gainsborough scholar John Hayes has characterized the work as ""a study from nature,"" yet we know from Gainsborough's friend Uvedale Price that he assembled in the studio ""roots, stones and mosses, from which he formed, and then studied, foregrounds in miniature.""In the hands of theorists such as Price, the idea of the Picturesque was expanded from Gilpin's conception, based on the paintings of Claude, to include rustic and low life genre scenes. Gainsborough's own taste for idyllic scenes of rustic peasant life played a key role in Price's thinking. Wooded Landscape with Figures [B1977.14.4697], a drawing from the end of Gainsborough's life, together with the painting which he developed from it, Peasant Smoking at a Cottage Door (University of California at Los Angeles), represent the culmination and the most monumental statement of this line of imagery in Gainsborough's work.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Scott Wilcox","2001-05"

He accompanied the pair to Athens, and he shared their goal of increasing public knowledge and acceptance of classical Greek architecture. To this end, he published The Grecian Orders of Architecture delineated and explained from the Antiquities of Athens in 1768 and dedicated it to James Stuart. This design appears in simplified form as Plate VI in the second volume of Grecian Orders as ""The Design for a New Street in the City."" With these designs he hoped to illustrate the adaptability of forms such as the pedimented façade and Doric colonnade to the building projects of London, in this instance the planned construction of a new street leading from the Mansion House to Moorgate.

"31236","108","603154","7112","2","Gainsborough was an active printmaker but rarely published prints in his own lifetime. He began making private experiments with aquatint from the early 1770s, possibly with advice from Paul Sandby. This new technique was about the only method of graphic reproduction that could come close to capturing the effects of Gainsborough’s painterly draftsmanship. The plate for this print was made in the mid 1780s and is typical of the kind of rustic scenery that Gainsborough was producing at the end of his career through which he sought an immediate emotional response from the viewer. His mind invariably conjured up images of rural life whenever he fantasized about escaping the drudgery of routine work painting portraits. This impression was published by John Boydell in 1797 after Gainsborough’s death.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Matthew Hargraves","2011"

"46623","108","634258","2049","2","Cooper's talent for portraying likeness is supremely demonstrated in this exquisite miniature. Long misidentified, the sitter was correctly identified as Charles Stuart, 3rd Duke of Richmond and 6th Duke of Lennox (1639–72), by Patrick Noon (Noon, 1979, pp. 8–9). Noon recognized the close physical resemblance between the sitter in this work and that of Richmond in a full-length portrait painted by Sir Peter Lely (ca. 1661; North Carolina Museum of Art, Raleigh). Close—almost exact—correspondence between a number of Cooper miniatures and large-scale oil portraits by Lely strongly suggests that the two artists (who lived near each other in Covent Garden) collaborated after the mid-1650s. Although the precise nature of their artistic partnership remains uncertain, it seems most likely that Lely turned to Cooper's portraits—many of which remained unfinished in his studio until his death (they were probably used by the miniaturist to make replicas)—in the creation of his full-scale oil portraits. In fact, among these unfinished works in his studio was a portrait of Richmond with “the face finished and the rest in sketch only” (Foskett, 1974, pp. 63–65). The present miniature, fully finished and signed in monogram, is certainly not that referred to above, but it may be a replica of this lost unfinished work.Painted probably around 1661, when Richmond was made Gentleman of the Bedchamber and Knight of the Order of the Garter, this portrait depicts him at the height of his career at court. Unfortunately, he did not live up to his political or military promise and is mainly remembered for his profligate love affairs. In 1667 he eloped with Frances Teresa Stuart (1647/8–1702), a choice of bride that proved perilous. His elopement with the well-known object of the king's—apparently unrequited—desire led to the couple's immediate banishment from court; they were allowed to return only after she recovered from a near-fatal case of smallpox. Notorious for his dissolute lifestyle, Richmond died in 1672, at the age of thirty-three, leaving his beautiful bride with a vast fortune and her freedom.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Julia Marciari-Alexander","2007-01"
"14277","108","634510","1252","2","Over the course of his stay in Italy, Wilson developed into a draftsman of great subtlety and delicacy. One of the crowning achievements of his years there is the series of sixty-eight finished landscape drawings, which Lord Dartmouth commissioned from Wilson following his two oil paintings of Rome. Of the drawings, twenty-some are known today. “The Temple of Minerva Medica” is one of two from the set now in the Yale Center for British Art. Because of the statue of Minerva found within it, the fourth-century ruin was thought to be a temple to the goddess, though it is now believed to have been a nymphaeum, or fountain structure, in the Gardens of Licinius. The dome visible in Wilson’s drawing collapsed in 1828. While Wilson’s drawings for Dartmouth are topographical in that they depict actual views in Rome and its environs, his choice of media—black and white chalk on blue paper—reflects not the standard practice of the topographical draftsman, which would have been pen and ink with watercolor, but the techniques employed at the Académie Française in Rome, redolent of the traditions of Old Master drawing.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Scott Wilcox","2007-01"

The tree in Wilson’s drawing is presumably the one mentioned by his pupil Thomas Jones, when he visited Nemi in April 1778: “All went to make sketches about the Lake of Nemi—particularly a large Plane tree call’d the Arbor Santa, which has a hollow within that I believe w’d contain about a dozen persons &amp; I was told that my Old Master Willson when in this Country made use of it as a Study to paint in” (Jones, “Memoirs”, p. 58).","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Scott Wilcox","2007-01"

"14530","108","634517","9449","2","Although he lived and worked in London throughout his career, Hills specialized in scenes of rural life. He painted at least three versions of this view of village life in winter (others are in the Spooner Collection, Courtauld Institute of Art, London, and in a private collection). The work is a combination of the real and the ideal, inspired in part by a seventeenth-century Flemish painting “A Barn in Winter” (Royal Collection, UK), then attributed to Peter Paul Rubens, which Hills saw when it was exhibited at the British Institution in 1819. At the same time, Hills was committed to studying figures from life. As his friend W. H. Pyne observed in his “Rustic Figures in Imitation of Chalk” (1817), “To become acquainted with the true rustic character, the student must go to nature, and view this class of people in their occupations” (p. ii). The figures in “A Village Snow Scene” portray these dual aspects as villagers seek shelter from a snowstorm in a barn. Hills delineates each person’s costume and the details of their setting, from the distinctive shape of a woman’s bonnet to the structural support of the barn that offers shelter. As Christiana Payne notes, village life continues during the storm: two blacksmiths work on the left and cattle are driven down the road (Payne, 1993, p. 155). Yet the figures remain types rather than individuals, their faces expressionless or obscured. The snow becomes the subject of the work: Hills render the bright white areas by leaving the paper untouched, a gesture that lends both texture and depth to the blankets of snow that cover the rooftops. He achieved the glimmering effect of falling snow by scraping out each snowflake.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Morna O'Neill","2007-01"

The stark setting is appropriate because this portrait represents the artist Adam Buck, his wife, and two of their sons in the presence of a herm (or bust on a plain shaft), which probably depicts a deceased member of the family. Ian Jenkins has traced a convincing narrative of mourning and rebirth in the iconography of the Greek vases on display, in keeping with the melancholy inclusion of the herm. The loving interaction between mother and baby, as well as the rambunctious antics of the elder child (who playfully dips a cat into an ancient vase), however, are strategies of representation familiar from Buck’s sentimental genre scenes. Melding the somber and the joyful, Buck succeeded in creating a picture that is a celebration of the continuation of family, as well as a memorial to a member lost along the way.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Cassandra Albinson","2007-01"
"15222","108","634520","2052","2","This drawing is one of a pair that were traditionally considered to be self-portraits by John Hamilton Mortimer, to whom Jefferys was close. In 1977, however, John Sunderland suggested persuasively that they were both of and by Jefferys, evidencing the age of the sitter (Mortimer was some ten years older), the close stylistic affinities with Jefferys’s known work, and, most significantly, the clear reference of the drawing in the background to “Pride Led by the Passions” (Maidstone Museum and Art Gallery), a drawing firmly attributed to Jefferys. Sunderland’s identification of sitter and maker is now accepted.The drawings depict front and back views of the artist, like two sides of a coin, and present contrasting aspects of the artistic life: disaffection and creativity. In the Center's drawing, Jefferys, wearing seventeenth-century costume and with romantically disheveled hair, holds a letter, apparently addressed to his godfather and early patron John Brenchley, in which he threatens to renounce his chosen profession. The inscription in the lower margin, “Rara avis in terra,” meaning “a rare bird on the earth,” is a quotation from the Roman satiric poet Juvenal, alluding, though perhaps not unironically, to Jefferys’s exceptional gifts and special status as a creative artist.The companion drawing, now in the National Portrait Gallery, London, shows the youthful genius with “porte-crayon” in hand, momentarily pausing from his labors on a drawing of the Massacre of the Innocents to confront his audience (which presumably might include his ""Professors,"" whose ""Folly and Vice"" he castigates in the inscription on the Center's drawing) with his intense stare.Although Jefferys’s portrayal of himself as a young misunderstood genius is very beguiling, there is clearly a strong element of posturing in these self-portraits, as Jefferys’s career in fact began extremely well. The artist did not live to fulfill his youthful promise, however (in this respect his self-portraits seem to have been somewhat prophetic), and he died in London at the age of thirty-two, allegedly having wasted his considerable talents through dissipation.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Gillian Forrester","2007-01"

"15332","108","634522","7020","2","This watercolor was made as a study for the print “The Rustic Lover”, published in 1787. During his time in Dublin, Wheatley began to paint scenes of peasant life, and upon returning to London he concentrated on this genre. Here he uses his signature technique from the 1780s: a pen outline is filled in with washes of softly hued pastel watercolor.“The Rustic Lover” is difficult to locate within debates about the representation of the peasant in eighteenth-century British art. On the one hand, Wheatley seems to suggest that his lower-class figures are morally compromised. The young girl’s dress is slipping off her shoulder as she turns to listen to the seductive words being whispered into her ear. However, the bird (a well-known symbol for female virtue) has not yet escaped from its protective cage. Here, and in other representations of peasants, Wheatley masters a delicate balancing act between lascivious humor and innocence. His female protagonist teeters on the brink of moral failure without falling into debauchery. This tension explains the popularity of images such as “The Rustic Lover”, as well as Wheatley's later series “The Cries of London”.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Cassandra Albinson","2007-01"
"15340","108","634523","6799","2","This portrait belongs to a relatively small group of monochrome drawings that Wright executed in the late 1760s and early 1770s in chalk. Despite the friability and dryness of the medium, the effects of light achieved here have much in common with the most adventurous oil paintings in which Wright pursued the study of highly complex effects of natural and artificial light in gloom: either natural gloom, as in the penumbra of twilight or the pitch darkness of night, or the gloom of interrupted or banished daylight. The consensus of opinion is that these drawings demonstrate Wright’s interest in, not to say indebtedness to, the medium of mezzotint, which had been used in May 1768 by William Pether to reproduce Wright’s somewhat sensational, recent “The Philosopher Giving a Lecture on the Orrery”, the first such reproductive print to be published after a work by Wright, and therefore, for any artist, a moment laden with professional and personal promise. But Wright had easy access to a plentiful supply of other models in mezzotint for life-sized portrait heads.When Paul Mellon bought the present drawing, it was thought to be a self-portrait and was published as such several times. However, it bears only a vague and superficial resemblance to securely documented self-portraits by Wright (ten in number) and indeed differs from them in several respects, namely, the cleft chin and the nose, which is much larger than Wright’s and decidedly hooked by comparison. Instead, Gillian Forrester has raised the possibility that this is a portrait of the artist’s good friend Peter Perez Burdett. Wright had painted Burdett and his wife in 1765, and Burdett reappears as a model in several of Wright's subject pictures, including the “Orrery” and “Three Persons Viewing the Gladiator by Candle-Light” (1765, private collection). The presence of fancy costume in this portrait, particularly the “Van Dyck” collar and cuff, which are also conspicuous in Wright’s “Academy by Lamplight”, of around 1768, is consistent with David Solkin’s suggestion that in the latter work “we are dealing with the projection of an imagined ideal as opposed to a portrayal grounded in reality” (Solkin, 1993, p. 242). Wright’s methods and recurring preoccupations defy easy categorization, however, and a form of dress that elsewhere conjures something of the formality and performance of masquerade here frames a portrait head of startling, disarming intimacy, and Rembrandtesque warmth.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Angus Trumble","2007-01"
"20041","108","634550","1252","2","Throughout his brief career, coastal landscape would be a mainstay of Bonington’s work in both watercolors and oils. His affinity for such subjects presumably dates from his period of study with Louis Francia in Calais in 1817. Francia had fled to England as a youthful refugee from the French Revolution and become part of the circle of Thomas Girtin in London. When he met Bonington, he had just returned to his native Calais and was beginning to establish himself as a drawing master and marine painter. Francia would undoubtedly have transmitted to his young pupil an awareness of British watercolor practice and a taste for naturalistic coastal scenes, both of which were novelties in France.In the autumn of 1821, while still in the atelier of Baron Gros, Bonington embarked on his first extensive sketching tour, traveling through Normandy and producing watercolors of the coast. He would leave Gros’s studio by the end of 1822. He spent most of 1824 based in Dunkerque, and though he was back in Paris in 1825, he was again sketching along the Channel coast with his artist friend Eugène Isabey in the autumn of that year. This watercolor probably derives from that time. Although the inscription on an old mount (now removed) gave the date as 1818, this is clearly a work of Bonington’s maturity, remarkably assured in its elegant and fluid use of the medium.

"19913","108","634590","9450","2","From the 1750s to the very last years of his life, Paul Sandby made frequent visits to Windsor. His elder brother, Thomas, served as a draftsman to the Duke of Cumberland in the early 1740s and was appointed Deputy Ranger of Windsor Great Park in 1747. This family connection, paired with a growing public interest in the castle—featured in travel guides—certainly explains why Sandby produced such a considerable number of Windsor views during his career.After collaborating with his brother on a set of eight engraved views of Windsor Great Park in the mid-1750s, Sandby pushed further his pictorial exploration of the castle, depicting it from every possible vantage point and at various angles. He exhibited eight views of Windsor Castle at the Society of Artists between 1763 and 1768. The present work, made around that time, is part of a set of four views of the castle in gouache in the Paul Mellon Collection (YCBA). Sandby’s Windsor subjects enjoyed great popularity, and he made several copies in gouache, watercolors, and oils, illustrating his versatility in multiple media. One such copy is a later version of the Norman Gate in the Royal Library, dated 1780, and of comparable dimensions (Oppé, 1947, nos. 13, p. 22). As is often the case with these replications, Sandby made some minor changes, such as removing the figures on the right and slightly modifying the garden’s shape. These views, taken altogether, provide vivid and charming architectural records of Windsor and its vicinity. They also suggest the extent to which, as an author quipped, “Windsor was Sandby’s bread and butter” (Robertson, 1987, p. 227).","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Stephane Roy","2007-01"

The present view southeast, along what was then known as Hampstead Road (now Haverstock Hill), is not far from the present Chalk Farm underground railway station. The eponymous cottage on the right was so named because the improvident early eighteenth-century Anglo-Irish essayist and playwright—his real name was Isaac Bickerstaff—for a time took refuge there from his creditors. It had previously been the residence of the dramatist and wit Sir Charles Sedley. The cottage was demolished in 1867.

Between 1800 and 1803 Blake lived in Felpham, Sussex, working on projects for Hayley. The relationship between the two poets was not an easy one. Although Hayley’s employment provided much-needed financial assistance, he encouraged Blake to put aside his more imaginative work, leading Blake to describe Hayley as “corporeal friend and spiritual enemy” (Bindman, 1977, p. 132).In 1802 Blake produced fourteen engravings to illustrate an edition of Hayley’s “Ballads”. A few years later, after Blake had returned to London from Felpham, he made new plates for a small-format edition of the “Ballads”. On 25 April 1805 he wrote to Hayley: “The prints, five in number, I have engaged to finish by 28th May. They are to be as highly finished as I can do them.” In the same letter he mentioned, “Of these five I am making little high finished pictures, the size the engravings are to be, and I am hard at it to accomplish in time what I intend.” This tempera, which reproduces at the same size the illustration for “The Horse,” may be one of these “little high finished pictures.” The only other known candidate is a sepia drawing for “The Eagle” (Pierpont Morgan Library, New York). Blake’s tempera illustrates a mother calmly facing down a runaway horse who threatens her fearful child. Blake was particularly pleased with this design, and when he thought the print might be omitted from the “Ballads”, he wrote to Hayley to argue for its inclusion as “one of my best; I know it has cost me immense labour” (Butlin, 1981, no. 366).","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Scott Wilcox","2007-01"
"41226","108","634960","6799","2","These children were the only son and daughter of John Newton and his wife, Charity (née Gubbins), who lived at Millaton House at Bridestowe, in Devon. Based on the birth dates of the Newton children (John, in 1826, and Mary, in 1823), the picture cannot have been painted before 1833. Although much is known about the sitters and their wealthy parents, until recently there were no clues in the provenance to help answer the question of attribution. In 1963, Basil Taylor attributed the picture to the expatriate Swiss animal painter Jacques-Laurent Agasse (1767–1849), noting that “before settling in England in 1800, Agasse studied under David and the strong clarity of his forms and the closely integrated organization of his design [i.e., of the Newton portrait] derive as much perhaps from that source as from the Swiss tradition to which he obviously belongs.” Only these, or sources equally distant from Cornwall, were sufficient to account for the “mesmeric force” of the painting's realism, its “clarity and precision of detail.” The picture did not seem English enough. “It stands quite apart from the romantic bravura and exaggerated expressiveness of the typical portraiture of its time, dominated as that was by the style and spirit of Sir Thomas Lawrence” (Taylor, 1963, p. 276). In 1978 Egerton devised an ingenious and, in many ways, better argument, linking this somewhat isolated West Country subject with the Scottish portrait and history painter John Zephaniah Bell (1793–1883). Echoing Taylor’s thoughts about Agasse, Egerton cited in Bell’s favour the “clarity, strong lines and quasi-heroic composition [that] link it rather with the portraiture of David and his pupils, presupposing some continental training in the artist” (Egerton, 1978, pp. 286–87). But, in this case, notwithstanding her own view that the portrait “stands quite apart from the typical British portraiture of its time,” Egerton based her attribution on the Newton painting’s close resemblance to an 1829 father-and-daughter portrait by Bell, “David Ogilvy, 9th Earl of Airlie, and His Daughter, Clementina, Aged Nine” (Earl and Countess of Airlie, Cortachy Castle, Kirriemuir, Angus), further suggesting that the Newton portrait might have been painted in London (Egerton, 1978, pp. 286–87). This would account for Bell’s otherwise conspicuous lack of West Country clientele.Both hypotheses turned out to be wrong. In preparation for the 2001 exhibition “The Paul Mellon Bequest: Treasures of a Lifetime”, the Newton portrait was cleaned by the paintings conservator Lance Mayer, who discovered the signature of Robert Burnard lurking in the foliage in the upper left corner. This is the only surviving portrait that has been securely ascribed to Burnard from the period prior to his immigration to South Australia, though its sophistication surely suggests that others may yet be identified.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Angus Trumble","2007-01"

Until the end of Paul Mellon’s life, “Pumpkin” remained one of his favorite paintings.By Match’em out of Old Squirt Mare, the chestnut Pumpkin was foaled in 1769. In twenty-four starts he won sixteen races, many of them at Newmarket, altogether worth 6,090 guineas and nine hogsheads of claret. In 1772, in his first race, Pumpkin beat the favorite, Denmark, by half a neck. It was thought to be one of the finest races ever run on English turf. He went on to win a long series of matches in the subsequent three seasons. Pumpkin's owner was the 2nd Baron Foley, who commissioned Stubbs’s portrait. Lord Foley was a member of the Jockey Club, a racing crony of Charles James Fox, and the Presbyterian heir to an iron and coal fortune.Stubbs’s rendition of the stable lad, who is presumably about nine or ten years old, is exquisitely sensitive, conveying seriousness and responsibility as much as boyish charm: he holds a sieve, from which he feeds his charge. Stubbs painted three other portraits of Pumpkin, each with the jockey William South in Foley's blue-and-white racing colors (at Ascott House [National Trust]; with H.M. the Queen; and with the Earl of Halifax), but the warmth of the stable lad’s rose-red jacket and the unusual glimpse of white paling fence beyond the dip in the middle distance are typical of Stubbs’s supremely inventive approach to the composition and coloring of his portraits of thoroughbred racehorses.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Angus Trumble","2007-01"

The position of the Wedgwood stamp, moreover, strongly suggests that the oval plaque was cut with a grinder from the bottom of a Queen's Ware plate and that Stubbs created the present work as an experiment with which to demonstrate (maybe to the manufacturer) the possibility and promise of painting in enamel on Wedgwood earthenware.In the 1770s distinctions among the various species of big cat were still rather vague, and the English word tiger was frequently used as a generic term to describe them all except lions. This is why the present work has plausibly been identified with the reference to a ""sleeping tiger"" in the artist's posthumous sale of 26 May 1807, despite the unequivocal spots.Paul Mellon loved this little painting and kept it on the desk in his study in the house he kept on East Seventieth Street in New York City","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Angus Trumble","2007-01"
"42119","108","634975","6799","2","This is one of two paintings that Marshall painted for Lord Darlington, whose busy stud was at Raby Castle, near Durham in the north of England. The other picture, formerly in the collection of Lord Barnard, is a portrait of another of Lord Darlington's thoroughbred racehorses, the champion Haphazard. Muly Moloch was foaled in 1798. His sire was John Bull (by the famous Herod, a descendant of the Byerly Turk), who won the Derby in 1792. Muly Moloch's dam was a mare called Mistletoe, the daughter of Pot-8-os (also known as 'Pot-""oooooooo""-s,' the winner of thirty races and the sire of three Derby winners). Muly won seven out of thirteen races from 1800 to 1803 and competed against some of the strongest horses of his generation. He did well in 1801 but in 1802 was overtaken and humiliated by Quiz, first in August at York, then again the following month in the St. Leger at Doncaster. Although Muly had begun as a favorite, odds were rapidly readjusted, and in 1803 the horse was given a long break from racing. He was defeated again in October, when Lord Darlington attempted a comeback at Newmarket, after which Muly was retired to stud.The painting records with considerable verity the restlessness of the horse, whose heart is still racing after the contest and for whom the brushing, scraping, and rubbing down are disturbing. The horse blanket and drench bottle (probably port or brandy, administered before the race) are clearly shown in the foreground. The stable lad's name was Tod, and the three onlookers are Hardy, the trainer (gesturing with emphasis); Thompson, the head gardener at Raby Castle; and Trotter, an elderly tenant of Lord Darlington's and an enthusiastic connoisseur of the turf. Marshall was particularly skillful at the characterization of his rich patrons' tenants and servants, as Stubbs was before him. The task of creating affectionate but plausible portraits of men such as this, with whom the squire shared a love and enthusiasm for sport but whose social position was unambiguously inferior to and indeed dependent upon his, created a delicate problem of decorum for artists whose own social and professional situation brought them approximately into the range of positions to which servants aspired and in which tenants to some extent felt secure; but it also required them to see servants, tenants and farmworkers, gamekeepers, and stable lads through the eyes and with the instincts, sympathy, and imagination of the squire.The name Moloch appears in Leviticus, the second Book of Kings, and the prophet Jeremiah as the name of an idolatrous Canaanite god of fire. The affectionate use of the bucolic prefix Muly implies stubbornness and earthy persistence, underlying the hot color, theatricality, and flamboyance of the Hebrew name.

In the middle ground, a red-brick shop partially obscures the tower that in the sixteenth century was added to the side of the medieval church facing the street, but never completed. Stands of trees that surround the church and partially obscure the peculiarities of its hybrid form also prevented Constable from finding an unobstructed vantage point from which to record a view of the whole building. Constable's maternal grandfather had been rector of East Bergholt church. When Constable was growing up, he worshiped there with his family on Sundays and walked past the church on his way to and from Dedham Grammar School.

The uncultivated, elevated heath, exposed and windy, an aerie from which to gaze at the great and equally unagricultural metropolis below, was a place of sand and gravel pits, a place of relative desolation, of sticks and gorse, of burning off, a condition of land, it was feared, to which cultivated pasture might easily revert should it be left fallow or abandoned, a primitive condition from which it is not difficult to imagine Constable lifting his gaze to trace and observe the casting of broad shadows over the heath's uneven contours by clouds scudding overhead. For it was this landscape, not so much the farms of Suffolk, that first inspired Constable's sustained study of the weather and the building of a repertoire of skies from which to borrow in the larger studio landscapes.

His uncle and aunt, King William IV and Queen Adelaide, with whom he spent long periods at court at Windsor, were childless, and even though Prince George's father, Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, who acted as his brother's viceroy in the tiny German kingdom of Hanover, was the tenth child and seventh son of George III and Queen Charlotte, there were few legitimate male grandchildren of George III. Apart from his cousin Princess Victoria of Kent, heir presumptive to the throne, who, though tiny, was not particularly delicate, relatively few steps separated the young man from the throne of England. An alternative idea that was seriously entertained by King William was that Prince George would make a splendid husband and consort for Princess Victoria. They were almost exactly the same age, but in due course neither relished the prospect of marriage to the other.Owing to Salic laws of succession in continental Europe (that is, the mandatory inheritance of the throne by the nearest male heir), after the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837, the crowns of Britain and Hanover were separated almost 125 years after they were first united under King George I. Thenceforth, Ernest, Duke of Cumberland, another of the new queen's many Hanoverian uncles, reigned as King of Hanover. With no further need for a viceroy in Hanover, the Cambridge family returned to England, and Prince George joined the British army, enjoying a distinguished career and eventually retiring with the rank of field marshal and commander-in-chief. Conforming to the manners of the previous generation, in 1840 Prince George contracted a morganatic marriage to an actress, Louisa, Miss Fairbrother, for whom he provided a house in Queen Street, Mayfair, where she settled comfortably as ""Mrs. Fitzgeorge"" and produced three sons.This painting was engraved by W.

"47086","108","635011","9450","2","This drawing offers a salient contrast, both in technique and composition, to Barlow’s “Man Hunting with a Pointed Staff and a Hound”. The use of wash gives this boisterous composition nuance and substance; its tonal gradations made it well suited for James Collins to make a mezzotint after this drawing. Barlow’s distinctive penciling, with its nervous baroque delineations, aptly renders foliage and the animals’ furriness. Equally distinctive is Barlow’s staging of the action, where the whole surface is used. The artist’s apparent reluctance to leave empty spaces often amounted, in many of his works, to an odd assemblage of birds and animals, as if one were contemplating a curiosity cabinet. Yet, in the present drawing, a great sense of coherence and movement emerges as the emphasis is given to the chase rather than to the catch; the action, hemmed in an imaginary Italianate landscape (distant ruins, bell tower, etc.), flows effortlessly from an enclosed woody space out to an open field.Although undated, this drawing shares many features of one of Barlow’s compositions for his Aesop's Fable 41, “The Hares and Storm” (1666). The rising heron is found elsewhere in Barlow's oeuvre (“Herons”, undated drawing, Tate, London; “Animals in landscape”, undated drawing, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford; “Hares and Storm"", undated drawing, British Museum, London). This motif demonstrates his skills at integrating drawings of birds and animals, done from life, into more formal compositions.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Stephane Roy","2007-01"
"46161","108","635020","2052","2","In his memoirs the Irish actor John O’Keefe recalled that his friend Healy “excelled at drawing in chalks, portraits, etc., but his chief forte was horses which he delineated so admirably that he got plenty of employment from those who had hunters, mares, or Ladies palfreys” (O'Keefe, 1826, vol. 1, p. 28). The only known evidence of Healy’s work in this genre, however, is a remarkable series of eight drawings made for the Conollys of Castletown in the late 1760s. Castletown, in County Kildare, was built in the 1720s by the wealthy Whig politician William Conolly. At his death in 1729 the Palladian mansion was still unfinished but, when his great-nephew Tom and his wife, Louisa, settled on the estate in 1759, they undertook an extensive program of renovations. Castletown was renowned for its informal hospitality, and in 1768–69 Healy chronicled the traditional recreations of hunting, shooting, and skating enjoyed by the Anglo-Irish aristocracy.The centerpiece of the series is this work, which Paul Mellon purchased when the drawings were sold in 1983 and bequeathed to the Center. Made on two sheets of paper, this ambitious and refined drawing, with its friezelike composition and attenuated forms, has close affinities with the work of George Stubbs. Louisa Conolly’s brother, Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond, was an important early patron of Stubbs, and Healy may have visited Richmond’s collection at Goodwood House. In any case, he probably would have known Stubbs’s engravings, which he might have seen in Louisa Conolly's print room at Castletown.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Gillian Forrester","2007-01"
"21333","108","635021","6799","2","This highly finished drawing is a preparatory study, squared up for transfer, for the self-portrait that Stubbs executed in 1781 on a Wedgwood oval plaque (National Portrait Gallery, London), probably for Mrs. Thorold, the wife of his good friend John Thorold of the Inner Temple—so said Ozias Humphry, who remains one of the very few, and far from wholly reliable, sources of biographical information about Stubbs. Although it was for many years identified as a portrait not of Stubbs but of Wedgwood, the final version of the plaque was correctly identified by Basil Taylor in 1965. It conforms to what we know about other preparatory drawings for Stubbs’s Wedgwood plaques. The technique of generating a composition for firing in enamel seems to have required a high degree of artistic decision-making in advance and a good deal of finish even prior to beginning work on the earthenware support. A number of Stubbs’s other squared-up drawings were recorded in the artist’s posthumous 1807 studio sale, but relatively few have been traced.To commemorate the centenary of the birth of the late Paul Mellon, the Yale Center for British Art recently purchased at auction in London one of a small group of other self-portraits by Stubbs: an exquisite, small oval painting of head and shoulders in oil on copper. This much earlier work serves as a valuable reminder that the oval format, and within it the three-quarter attitude facing the right, were firmly established both in the artist’s view of himself and in the mind-set of other artists, including Ozias Humphry and William Craft, who both portrayed Stubbs in almost identical formats.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Angus Trumble","2007-01"
"47397","108","635022","9450","2","John Wootton excelled in classical landscapes and sporting scenes, some on canvases of large proportions. The present drawing, though modest in size, represents an important hunting subgenre for Wootton: group portraits of hounds. Early in his career, Wootton painted numerous pictures in which hounds took center stage and humans played little or no role; for instance, “Hounds and a Magpie” (ca. 1716, Hermitage), formerly in Sir Robert Walpole’s collection, which was sold to Catherine the Great.Stylistically, this drawing bears some resemblance to “Althorp Hounds and the Magpie” (collection of the Earl Spencer), a fact emphasized by the “trompe de chasse” (hunting horn) suspended from a branch. A painting in the Yale Center for British Art, Releasing the Hounds (ca. 1740–50, B2001.2.290), offers even more striking compositional correspondence. Although dissimilar in size and techniques, they complete each other in that they represent different stages of hunting ritual—a theme that Wootton fully exploited in a set of four hunting scenes, from the gathering prior to the hunt up to the kill, known today through engravings by Bernard Baron dated 1726. It is difficult, in the present case, to know with certainty if the scene takes place before or after the hunt (no spoil is shown). The hounds, as Wootton captured them, are at rest among themselves, almost as if they were interacting. While some of Wootton’s studies denote a careful attention to hounds’ morphology (see, for instance, a sketch attributed to Wootton in The Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens, San Marino, Calif.), the artist seems here less concerned with physiological minutiae than with psychological perceptiveness. Wootton’s masterly appreciation of canine pantomime, where postures and inflexions appear capable of conveying emotions, results in a very refined conversation piece. This makes Wootton a predecessor, in every respect, of George Stubbs’s fine pictorial and psychological interpretation of animal character.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Stephane Roy","2007-01"
"17299","108","635112","6799","2","Paul Mellon acquired his lifelong love of country pursuits at Cambridge in 1930, and it was to encourage his interest in quintessentially English field sports that his mother, herself a keen horsewoman, presented him with the big Irish bay stallion called Dublin. In his memoirs, Mr. Mellon described Dublin as his favorite among the many hunters he had owned over a period of sixty years. “He pulled a bit and was strong as a locomotive,” wrote Mr. Mellon, “and was strong as a locomotive, but although a so-called three-quarter-bred, he had enough foot and staying power not to disgrace me in several point-to-points. He could have jumped the Eiffel Tower. I think it was Dublin more than anything else who assured my lifelong addiction to hunting. He had huge quarters and a wonderful long front, and his eye had the ‘look of eagles’” (Mellon, 1992, p. 228). In many respects, Munnings was a natural choice of artist for this commission because he had an established Anglo-American clientele, was himself passionate about foxhunting, and had painted similar open-air portraits of the Prince of Wales, the Princess Royal, and members of the English aristocracy. Mr. Mellon recalled bringing Munnings by train to the farm near Eastleach, in Gloucestershire, where Dublin was boarded, so that sketches could be made. Munnings returned there several times on his own, presumably feeling freer to go about his business unobserved. He chose, however, to execute the portrait of his young patron in the comfort of his studio in Chelsea. The result is the best surviving portrait of Paul Mellon, one that conveys not merely the sitter’s passion for sport but also his natural grace and elegance. Mr. Mellon’s companions in the background could belong to any of the three packs with whom he rode in Gloucestershire at this date: the Duke of Beaufort’s hounds, the Vale of White Horse Hunt (VWH Bathurst and Cricklade), and the Cotswold.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Angus Trumble","2007-01"

As part of his training there, he would have studied drawing from existing structures, sciagraphy (the depiction of architectural features using light and shade), and drawing from life. A pupil of Sir William Chambers (cats. 116-17) from 1764 Yenn was later employed as a clerk in Chambers office, eventually becoming chief architectural draftsman. Scholars have characterized Yenn as a ""faithful disciple of Chambers,"" and indeed Chambers himself described his pupil as ""an ingenious faithful intelligent servant' as late as 1774. While his designs indicate the influence of Chambers's neoclassical style, Yenn's work is distinguished by its delicate line and color. Color became an important aspect of late eighteenth-century architectural drawing, as the influence of French neoclassical architects who favored the practice coincided with the development of watercolor cakes, which made the medium accessible to those who did not know how to mix their own pigments. The use of color in the architectural interior received great attention in this period, when architects designed no only the exterior but also the interior décor, the furniture, and even the doorknobs. Yenn's use of light pinks and greens indicates his knowledge of color theory, as it echoes exactly the definition of ""beautiful color"" supplied by Edmund Burke in his Philosophical Inquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and the Beautiful of 1757: ""the colours of beautiful bodies must not be dusky or muddy, bur clean and fair…those which see, most appropriate to beauty are the milder of every sort: light greens, soft blues, weak whites, pink reds and violets.""","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Morna O'Neill","2001-05"

"49600","108","703169","1252","2","The Alsatian artist Phillppe Jacques de Loutherbourg arrived in London in 1771, having already established himself in Paris as a successful painter of pastoral landscapes and dramatic shipwreck scenes. with an introduction to the actor-manager David Garrick, Loutherbourg gained employment designing scenery for productions at the Drury Lane Theatre. He also explored the beauties of the English and Welsh countryside, making pioneering use of the actual scenery of Britain in his theatrical work, in paintings exhibited at the Royal Academy, and in publications.This Pastoral landscape, which may well predate Loutherbourg's move to England, is a decorative artificial construct rather than a transcript of nature. In that sense it is not far removed from the synthetic approach to landscape advocated by Alexander Cozens, and its components - the watering cattle in a shaded pool, the sleeping herd boy, the tête-à-tête of hunter and milkmaid - are very much the standard elements of Thomas Gainsborough's landscape creations, though rendered with a delicacy and fastidiousness of touch in place of Gainsborough's bravura draftsmanship. Loutherbourg and Gainsborough were in fact friends, and a portrait sketch of Gainsborough by Loutherbourg is in the Yale Center for British Art.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Scott Wilcox","2001-05"
"21333","108","703170","2052","2","Artists in the eighteenth century often made self-portraits to explore and fashion their personal artistic identities. Cat. 149 is on of a pair of self portraits by the little-known historical draftsman James Jefferys and formerly attributed to John Hamilton Mortimer (see cat. 330. The drawings depict front and back views of the artist, like two sides of a coin, and present contrasting aspects of the artistic life: disaffection and creativity. In the Center's drawing the romantically disheveled Jefferys holds a letter, apparently addressed to his godfather and early patron John Brenchly, which renounces his chosen profession. The inscription from the Juvenal in the lower margin, ""Rara avis in terra' meaning, ""a rare bird on the earth,"" alludes to Jefferys's exceptional gifts and special status as a creative artist. The companion drawing, now in the National Portrait Gallery, London, shows the youthful genius with porte-crayon in hand, momentarily pausing from his labors on a drawing of the Massacre of the Innocents, as if receiving inspiration.At first sight Stubb's self portrait may seem to betray little about its author's personality, but this careful drawing is nonetheless revealing. Made as a study for his self portrait in enamel (National Portrait Gallery, London), the drawing is squared up to facilitate transfer of the image to the larger ceramic plate. The high degree of finish says much about Stubb's meticulous approach to his art, and his legendary powers of observation and extreme reticence are indicated by his composed but watchful expression. In the 1770s Stubbs collaborated successfully with the master-potter Josiah Wedgwood on the production of large enamel plaques. Stubbs evidently found the smoothness and durability of the medium extremely appealing although susceptible to cracking, their coloration remains unchanged over time), and he seems to have used enamel chiefly for his favorite subjects and for portraits of people he knew well. The inscription on the back of the finished self-portrait indicates that Stubbs made it for his friend Richard Thorold.Cat. 1550 is a rare example of a preparatory drawing by Stubbs. His 1808 posthumous studio sale included at least thirteen lots of ""drawings, drawing books, studies from Nature, sketches, &amp;c,"" but with the exception of the major groups of studies for the Anatomy of the Horse and Comparative Anatomy (see cats. 64-8), only a handful of drawings by him are now known. It seems likely that Stubbs would have made careful studies for his paintings, but the mysterious disappearance of the drawings and his notorious secretiveness regarding his artistic practice have made it difficult to reconstruct his working process conclusively.

The studies of ancient architectural ruins executed by Borra throughout the course of his journey provided illustrations for Robert Wood's 1753 the Ruins of Palmyra and his 1757 The Ruins of Balebc. This drawing is one of the group of ninety-eight finished drawings in the Center's collection that were intended to illustrate a further publication that was never produced. Attention to ancient architecture was an important part of a gentleman's education. Borra's drawings, engraved and published in Wood's volumes, aided the gentleman in his quest for knowledge and refinement; as Wood himself wrote in The Ruins of Balbec, ""we shall…refer our reader almost entirely to the plates, where his information will be more full and circumstantial, as well as less tedious and confused, that could be conveyed by the happiest of language. The careful study of all aspects of classical building provided the cornerstone of the architect's education. Architects like Borra trained as draftsmen in part to produce carefully measured renderings of ancient ruins. He delineates the details of the Corinthian order and its decoration=, following certain accepted standards such as the rendering o both the bottom and the top the column to indicate its tapering, and he provides a rubric to indicate scale. The depiction of different examples of the classical orders or columns was an important aspect of architectural drawing, as each order had its own particular forms and subsequent uses. The Corinthian, shown here, was one of the more elaborate and fanciful orders. Most architects traveled to view the buildings for themselves, while others had to rely on publications and the drawings of others for the education.

Reflecting Enlightenment views of the natural world, one of Hamilton's geological correspondents opined:I know of no subject that fills the mind with greater ideas than the volcanic history of the world…tis certainly a part of the great system of dissolution &amp; renovation which seems the Universal Law of Nature, by which a sparrow, a city, a region or a word, probably, have their beginning and end.Volcancic activity also had considerable aesthetic appeal and provided compelling subject matter for artists interested in exploring the notion of the Sublime. Italian architectural draftsman and civil engineer Giovanni Battista Borra accompanied Sir Robert Wood on his archaeological expedition to Asia Minor and Syria in 1750-1. Borra produced a large group of drawings, ninety-eight of which are in the Center's collection, subjects were engraved for Wood's publications on the ruins of Palmyra and Balbec (see cat. 118). During the expedition Borra also made studies of natural phenomena, including drawings of Stromboli, the volcanic island north of Sicily.

During the years he spent there, until 1756 or 1757, he gave up portraiture and devoted himself to landscape. In a series of lectures in 1836 devoted to the history of landscape painting, John Constable credited Wilson with ""opening the way to the genuine principles of Landscape in England,"" and stated that ""it was in Italy that [Wilson] first became acquantied with his own powers.""Although he was primarily a painter, over the course of his stay in Italy Wilson also developed into a draftsman of great subtlety and delicacy. One of the crowning achievements of his years in Italy is the series of finished landscape drawings for William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth. Lord Dartmouth, who made the Grand Tour in 1752-3, acquired two views of Rome in oils from Wilson (one of which, Rome from the Villa Madam, 1753, is in the Yale Center for British Art) and sixty-eight drawings. Of the drawings, twenty-some are known today. The Temple of Minerva Medica is one of two from the set now in the Yale Center for British Art. While Wilson's drawings for Dartmouth are topographical in that they depict actual views in Rome and its environs, his choice of media - black and white chalk on blue paper - reflects not the standard practice of the topographical draftsman, which would have been pen and ink with watercolor, but the techniques employed at the French Academy in Rome, redolent of the traditions of Old Master drawing.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Scott Wilcox","2001-05"

They imagined grand structures for London and the new Rome. Soane conceived of this design while working in Rome, and in his memoirs he describes is as a mix of ancient Roman and Italian Renaissance sources, part Pantheon, part Villa Farnese. Here he uses the popular neoclassical forms of the domed roods and the Corinthian pilasters in his fanciful sketch of a Royal Palace for Hyde Park. The pedimented temple façade and tall dome mark the center of the structure, and he includes the right wind in his depiction. Soane commissioned his chief architectural draftsman Joseph Michael Gandy to depict his structure in a perspective watercolor (Soane Museum, London). Gandy, an architectural draftsman like Thomas Malton (cat. 129), specialized in the perspectival depiction of imagined, ideal structures of his own or other's invention, as well as acting as chief draftsman for Soane's architectural practice.

After further studies in London and Rome Ramsay set up as a portrait painter in London in 1738; within a year he became ""the most imployed in ye portrait way of any"" and was particularly favored by the Scottish nobility. Ramsay was praised from early in his career for his ""delicate and Genteel"" portrayals of women. In his theoretical essay A Dialogue on Taste (1755) Ramsay identified ""naturalness"" as a highly desirable quality in art and his adoption in the mid _1750s of the more ""natural"" and refined style which he admired in the French pastellist Maurice Quentin de la Tour brought him further renown as a painter of women. As Horace Walpole noted in 1759, ""Mr. Reynolds seldom succeeds in women: Mr. Ramsay is formed to paint them.""Ramsay drew extensively, unusually for a British portrait painter of this period; a large number of preparatory studies for paintings survive (see cat. 153), and he also produced some highly-finished and exquisite portrait drawings. Cat. 3 is one of a group of drawings by Ramsay on blue paper in the Center's collection which formerly belongs to British collector Thomas Lowinsky (1892-1947). It is not known to be related to a painting, and the sitter has not been identified, but the features are similar to those of Ramsay's second wife, Margaret Lindsay, whom he painted and drew on several occasions.

"15150","108","703221","2052","2","Ramsay habitually made preparatory studies for his portraits, an unusual practice at the time, since most of his fellow portraitists preferred the more expedient method of drawing directly on the canvas. D drawing was an important element of Ramsay's training, first at the Academy of St. Luke I Edinburgh, and later in London at Hogarth's St. Martin's Lane Academy. This study is related to Ramsay's portrait of Sir William Guise of 1761. Early in his career Ramsay employed the accomplished drapery painter Joseph van Aken, who had arrived in London from Antwerp in 1720. Van Aken, or ""the tailor,"" as he was known, was initially employed by a number of portraitists but later worked only for Ramsay and Thomas Hudson. Van Aken also made studies, and the attribution of drawings related to Ramsay's painting can sometimes be problematic, though Ramsay was clearly the superior draftsman. Drapery painters were customarily used by the generation of portrait painters preceding Ramsay's, and after Can Van Aken's death in 1749 Ramsay employed studio assistants to paint drapery and backgrounds, as did many of his contemporaries who ran busy portrait-practices. Painting drapery, particularly the elaborate ""Van Dyck"" fancy-dress fashionable in the eighteenth century, was a time consuming process, and sitters' clothes and accoutrements were usually retained in the studio while the portraitist concentrated on the face during sittings. Unsurprisingly, Hogarth, with whom Ramsay enjoyed a disputatious friendship, was vociferously opposed to these practices and bitterly remarked that if an artists should ""persuade the public that he had brought a new discovered method of colouring"" (a palpable hit at Ramsay's technique), he need only ""hire one of those painted tailors fort an assistant"" to be a successful portrait painter.","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Gillian Forrester","2001-05"
"15222","108","703230","2052","2","Artists in the eighteenth century often made self-portraits to explore and fashion their personal artistic identities. Cat. 149 is on of a pair of self portraits by the little-known historical draftsman James Jefferys and formerly attributed to John Hamilton Mortimer (see cat. 330. the drawings depict front and back views of the artist, like two sides of a coin, and present contrasting aspects of the artistic life: disaffection and creativity. In the Center's drawing the romantically disheveled Jefferys holds a letter, apparently addressed to his godfather and early patron John Brenchly, which renounces his chosen profession. The inscription from the Juvenal in the lower margin, ""Rara avis in terra' meaning, ""a rare bird on the earth,"" alludes to Jefferys's exceptional gifts and special status as a creative artist. The companion drawing, now in the National Portrait Gallery, London, shows the youthful genius with porte-crayon in hand, momentarily pausing from his labors on a drawing of the Massacre of the Innocents, as if receiving inspiration.Although Jefferys's portrayal of himself as a misunderstood genius is very beguiling, there is a strong element of posturing in these self-portraits. Jefferys's career in fact began extremely well; in 1774 he was awarded prizes for historical drawings from the Society of Arts and the Royal Academy, and the following year he won one of the first traveling scholarships of the Society of Dilettanti with the support of Joshua Reynolds.

The portrait may have been commissioned to celebrate the marriage of her daughter Dorothy to Sir Thomas Barrett-Lennard, 1st Bart. of Belhaus in 1787, the year the drawing was executed, and the figures on the left may be Dorothy and her fiancé or husband, or her brother, Sir John St. Aubyn, 5th Bart. of Clowance and St. Michael's Mount, Cornwall. The drawings belonged to Dorothy, and it remained in the Barrett-Lennard family until 1923.Johann Heinrich Ramberg was born in Germany; he studied in London with Benjamin West from 1781 to 1788 but does not seem to have pursued his career as a history painter very seriously. Best known as a caricaturist, theater designer, and illustrator, Ramberg was influenced by the graphic work of Hogarth and Rowlandson (see cats. 7, 86-9, 148, 154), and the latter's drawing style is evident in the Aubyn family portrait.

Apprenticed to the portrait painted Francis Cotes, Russell set up his own practice in 1767 and was appointed Crayon Painter to King George III and to George, Prince of Wales, in 1788. Russell evolved a distinctive and effective technique, which he elucidated in his popular manual, Elements of Painting with Crayons (1772). After tracing the sitter's outline in chalk on blue paper and laying in the colors, Russell smudged the outlines using his fingers and crayon; the resulting blurred effect and velvety textures endowed his portraits with remarkable vitality and luminosity. This portrait, which is in almost perfect condition, is a very fine example of his work and demonstrates aptly Cotes's statement that ""crayon pictures, when finely painted, are superlatively beautiful, and decorative in a very high degree in apartments that are not too large; for, having their surface dry, they partake in appearance of the effect of Fresco, and by candle light are luminous and beautiful beyond all other pictures.""Russell frequently incorporated animals into his pastels, but the inclusion of a ram into his portrait of the Wiltshire wool merchant John Collins (fl 1771-99) is particularly noted: ""Let Embellishments of the Picture, and introduction of Birds, animals, &amp;c. be regulated by the rules of propriety and consistency."") Described by the local historian James Waylen as ""an antiquary in mind, manners and dress,"" Collins bequeathed his library to the Baptist Chapel at Broughton, Hampshire; the Chapel subsequently acquired this portrait. The circumstances of its production are unknown, but the pastel was still in Russell's studio at his death and may have been a rejected commission, by no means an unusual occurrence for a professional portraitist of the period.

The early provenance for cat. 12 is no known, and it is undated, but, according to scholar Benedict Nicolson, the original backboard was inscribed in another hand with the date of 1768m and the style seems consistent with Wright's work of this period. It has been suggested convincingly that Wright's chalk studies may have been influenced by a group of drawings and related mezzotint engravings of life size heads by Thomas Frye (1710-62), but , in any case, these essays in monochrome are congruent with Wright's lifelong preoccupation with exploring the relationship between light and dark. The rich texture of the chalk medium resembles mezzotint, and Wright also may have been inspired by the appearance in May 1768 of William Pether's mezzotint after his celebrated nocturnal painting, The Philosopher Giving a Lecture on the Orrey, which was the first print after his work was published.Nicolson identified cat. 12 as a self-portrait, but it does not resemble any authenticated self-portraits or portraits of Wright. The directness of the man's gaze suggests a close relationship between sitter and artist, and the features are very similar to those of the artist's friend Peter Perez Burdett. Wright painted a double portrait of Burdett and his wide in 1765, and Burdett almost certainly was the model for figures in Wright's Orrey and Three persons Viewing the Gladiator by Candle-light, which were first exhibited in the mid-1760s.

Bruce brought back the drawings intact to Britain against enormous odds, and they remained in the family together with journals, letters, and other archival records relating to the expedition until Paul Mellon acquired them in 1968; he gave the collection to the Center nine years later, and it provides an invaluable resource for the natural historian and a fascinating view into eighteenth-century scientific endeavors. The authorship of the drawings has been highly problematic and has only been elucidated in recent years. Bruce was an amateur artist and also made drawings during the expedition. Balugani died in Ethiopia, and after Bruce returned to Britain he claimed the draftsman's work as his own. Bruce seems to have been somewhat of a fantasist (Sir Walter Scott recorded that the explored Henry Salt, who followed in Bruce's footsteps and was one of his severest critics, ""corroborated…Bruce and all his material facts,"" but felt that he considerably exaggerated his personal consequence and exploits""),and the temptation to appropriate his draftsman's achievements evidently was overwhelming.In his published account of the expedition, Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile, Bruce stressed Balugani's shortcomings as an artists and lack of moral integrity, and it seems likely that he was jealous of the younger man's considerable and superior talents. Although some of Bruce's contemporaries harbored suspicions regarding the authenticity of ""his"" drawings, their authorship was not systematically investigated until the 1980s, when curators Patrick Noon and Paul Hulton, in collaboration with botanists Nigel Hepper and Ib Friis, undertook a thorough study of the plant drawings at the center and revealed that all were almost certainly the work of Balugani.The four finished watercolors included in this catalogue represent a tiny sample of the hundreds of drawings by Balugani in the center's collection. Balugani made ten drawings of Ensete Ventricosum, the African wild banana. Bruce noted that the wild banana ""grows and comes to great perfection at Gondar, but it most abounds that part of Maitsha and Goutto west of the Nile where there are large plantations of it""; he described the plant as ""one of the most beautiful productions of nature, as well as most agreeable and wholesome food of man."" Carthamus tinctorius, or safflower, has been used since ancient Egyptian times as an orange-yellow dye for textiles.Balugani made several drawings of reptiles. Bruce conjectured, romantically, that Cerastes was most likely to have been the species of viper ""which Cleopatra employed to procure her own death."" One day, when Bruce and his party were sailing in the Red Se, their ship was surrounded by ""a prodigious number of sharks…of the hammer-headed kind."" Bruce harpooned one of the sharks, possibly the one illustrated by cat. 62 [B1977.14.9129]. He described the shark as ""eleven feet seven inches from his snout to his tail, and nearly four feet round in the thickest part of him. He had in him a dolphin very lately swallowed, and about half-a-yard of blue cloth.""","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Gillian Forrester","2001-05"

The Daniells sought to surpass Hodges both in the extent of their travel and view taking and in the topographical accuracy. They remained in India until 1794, when they returned to England and began working up their Indian drawings for publication. Their monumental Oriental Scenery, with 144 aquatints, was issued in six volumes from 1795 to 1808During their travels around India, the Daniells employed a camera obscura (see cat. 138) to produce detailed pencil drawings such as the one of Tremal Naig's Choultry in Madura. The drawing, made in July 1792 during a tour of south India, shows the Choultry or Thousand-pillared Hall of Rajah Tremal Naig. The aquatint based on the drawing was published as a Plate 18 in the second volume of Oriental Scenery in 1798.

The Schools' curriculum in the late eighteenth century did no include oil painting, and, like his fellow-student Hugh Douglas Hamilton (see cat. 11), Healy specialized in pastel and chalk drawings. Healey's promising career was cut short when he died at twenty-eight, and the few works by him known to have survived are distinctive drawings in grisaille, that is, a subtle blend of monochrome and color pigments. Healy may have been influenced by the Irish artist Thomas Frye's monochrome chalk portrait heads, but his accomplished drawings go beyond Frye's in terms of finish and sophistication. The pseudonymous Dublin critic Anthony Pasquin observed that they were ""proverbial for their exquisite softness: - they look like fine proof prints of the most capital mezzotinto engravings.""In his memoirs the actor John O'Keeffe recalled that his friend Healy ""excelled at drawings in chalks, portraits, etc., but his chief forte was horses which he delineated so admirable that he got plenty of employment from those who had hunters, mares, or Ladies palfreys."" The only known evidence of Healy's work in the genre, however, is a remarkable series of drawings made for the Connolys of Castletown in the late 1760s. Castletown in Count y Kildare was built in the 1720s by the wealthy Whig politician William Conolly At his death in 1729 the Palladian mansion was still unfinished, but, when his great-nephew Tom and his wife Louisa settled on the estate in 1759, they undertook an extensive program of renovations. Castletown was renowned for its informal hospitality, and in 1768-9 Healy chronicled the traditional recreations of hunting, shooting, and skating enjoyed by the Conollys. The centerpiece of the group is cat. 92, an ambitious frieze like drawing with close affinities with the work of George Stubbs. ","L","111","111","Curatorial comment","Gillian Forrester","2001-05"
